Certainly no SOCIOPATHIC reason, Utahraptor.
It wasn't meant to be!
I have no {{censored}} clue!
Hah hah, you hate babies!
HEY EVERYONE T-REX HATES BABIES
Everyone! Be just like me!
Aw man, do those exist?
Eat my weight in chocolate?
Okay! So, um... let's- fletcherize?
Okay, how was your day?
Feelings: let's talk about them!
You probably did, my friend!
Well, as I was saying-
What do those taste like?
And how did that taste?
Okay!  Thanks for that!
That doesn't sound so bad!
This source says: DEFINITELY YES.
Okay - why vanilla extract?
No wonder nobody likes me!
JOKES EXPLAINED PRESENTS: "CONFUCIUS SAY"
As I see it, yes!
Dude!  It's SO GOOD.
I think so.  Maybe?
You're late for class, T-Rex!
. . . for PROFIT!
You are a good dude!
I want my money back.
I've got one for you!
Who is this "Timmy" guy?
Hah hah! Ouch for Timmy!
I - I got caught.
Alright. T-Rex: not necessarily racist.
It could well be, Utahraptor!
We've probably all been there.
SERIOUSLY IT'LL BE A HOOT
IT'LL BE SO MUCH FUN
THAT WAS SO IMPROBABLY FAST!
A FEW DAYS LATER: CONSEQUENCES!
THAT NIGHT, AT THE PARTY:
The answer is "Definitely yes!"
That's seriously me right now!
Didn't you graduate years ago?
Drominica: Mind those lego models.
Ryan: Thanks for the tip!
It sounds cruel to me!
Do I dare ASK IT?
You're right that is inappropriate.
I'm willing to accept yes!
What makes PERL so special?
DO NOT LESSEN THE METAPHOR!
What does the girl represent?
Are you going to sneeze?
Ha ha. Old Billy Cosby.
News Flash: Reality is super-awesome!
So, how's the experiment going?
Can't mice also live outdoors?
Dud, WHAT ABOUT THE INTERNET??
YOU HAVE KILLED AN ORC
TO WHICH THE PLAYERS REPLY
Have you ever played one?
This isn't a race, T-Rex!
THAT'S SUCH A SUCKY PRANK
It sort of sucks, man!
I - I don't know!
I have surprised even myself!
DROMICEIOMIMUS: AVOCADO SANDWICHES, ORANGE JUICE
Pleased to meet you, Morris!
Neighbours: WHAT ARE THE ODDS
SUDDENLY, A VISION OF TOMORROW!
Man! Don' leave me hangin'!!
HEY T-REX SETTLE A BET
YOU AND YOUR FRIGGIN EYEBROWS
HEY T-REX WHAT WAS THAT
I wish for justified happiness!
I wish for more wishes!
Vitamin B12: What is it?
What foods provide vitamin B12?
Now, which language to choose...
Nenu gudlu, paalu, venna tinanu.
Things would indeed be different...
Hah!  I SURE have.
My favorite are the freegans!
Man, that's not positive either!
Yes. This is my concern.
Does reincarnation work on machines?
LOGICAL SOLUTIONS TO EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS
Another shot at immortality, T-Rex?
Because too much has changed!
T-REX IS TELLING THE TRUTH:
Hey, quit stomping on things!
Screw you, I'm going home.
No reason, just "#8212; sharing!
I don't recall saying that!!
"I have smelly pants." "#8212;Utahraptor.
Wildly misinterpret your own despair?
We're out of our league!
LATER, PROFANELY SPYING ON DROMICEIOMIMUS:
And yet here were are.
No-one! About - about nothing!
I'm wacky! I'm ultra wacky.
Hah! Diseases in the WATER?
what is the hold up
B-Because God told me to?
BUT LATER, ALL IS FORGOTTEN:
in this instalment: "JUST ASKING"
It's not manipulative! It's ADORING.
Yes! To grime and dirt!
I GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE
LATER: A MOMENT OF REFLECTION.
Batman doesn't have "nappy times"!!
A COMIC WITH FUNNY JOKES
Time for some funny jokes!
Even if they're not thirsty?
You gave me the idea!
Funny, I don't remember that.
But what if i could?
So, Dromiceiomimus - what's up?
Throw who off which trail?
Playing it cool, I see!
Offscreen commentator(s): Not really! 
That is so BARELY embarrassing.
I've actually done that too!
Aww! I'm sorry, imaginary dude!
Easy: my mom answers them!
That's a really charming answer!
LATER, RECORDING "ASK T-REX'S MOM"!
Um - he didn't specify?
MEANWHILE, IN A DYSTOPIAN FUTURE!
T-REX IN: "FLOWERS IN RELATIONSHIPS"
How was that an accident?
Yes!  Some people, anyway.
But - I'm not slutty!
No! Maybe! I don't know!
And the only way out?
Okay, okay! Just a sec!
And your kisses are yolky?
IT IS DIFFICULT TO TELL!
Utahraptor is afraid of ghosts!
I have been thinking lately
WITH THE BABY CARRIAGE? YEAH!
YEARS LATER: PROMISES ARE BROKEN.
A good choice, my friend!
You gave me shitty eyeballs!
And a lousy penis too!
That's pretty sexy, I'm told!
Hey! HEY DUDE!
