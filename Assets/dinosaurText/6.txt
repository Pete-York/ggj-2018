We're putting ego ASIDE today, Utahraptor.
Now I feel worse than ever!

Batman: THAT was a lucky guess
And make it really catchy, okay?
Hey! Hey you, across the street!
That's funny, because I smell fine!
Why yes, I am freshly showered!

Nope! Even authorities must justify themselves!
I saw it on the Internet!
My game's not appropriate AT ALL!

I'm attempting to build dramatic tension!
My children's children would thank me!
Holy Shit!  Leave me alone!
I thought cephalopods were underwater animals!
I don't want any trouble, cephalopods!
Raccoons and cephalopods: COME CLOSER, T-REX
Sometimes I get a little sad!
I'm open! I'm open! I'm open!
What manner of proof have you?
A small pet, perhaps something bite-sized...
Does this work for "woman" too?
I live with my man failings.
HEY YOU! ACROSS THE STREET! 
Hello T-Rex! How are you today?
But we've still got some time!
Guess what I got last night?
Yes, I accepted it without questioning.
What is that anyway, a place?
I hadn't even thought of that!
I imagine that is very true!
I AM THE WORST GRANDSON EVER.
Ohh, the world revolves around me!
Yes, the world revolves around me!
Got any plans for the summer?
The secret is to be CONTROVERSIAL!
A CONTROVERSIAL ass, though! Of fame!
So THAT'S what that feels like!
Fine!  I'll go do that!
Hmm.  That - that's true.
GREETINGS T-REX WHAT IS DUCK HUNT
IS DUCK HUNT A GOOD GAME
Is this house bothering you, Dromiceiomimus?
"HOW TO LIVE A MEANINGFUL LIFE"
That sounds like a good start!
So what's the deal here, T-Rex?
What?  No, of course not!
Come on!  Everyone knows it.
This is one weaksauce discovery, T-Rex!
So what's your anger management technique?
T-Rex, you're forgetting about Babbage engines!
Exactly! I'm glad you understand, Dromiceiomimus.
What's the worst that could happen?!
You think it could be different?
It's a thought fueled by rage!!
Somehow I don't see this happening.
However, this is not the case!
That's going to need some explaining!
T- That's not an explanation, T-Rex.
I know they conduct... semi- well?
I'm instantly convinced that I could!
Hey, care to make it interesting?
IS IT ADJECTIVE ENOUGH FOR YOU??
(I actually REALLY like that one!)
Holy shit, what are the odds?
I feel - fine!  Focused!
The 'k' indicates extra kraziness, Dromiceiomimus.
I'm glad you specified that, T-Rex.
Thanks for an awesome weekend, T-Rex!
Aww, you're not all bad, T-Rex!
But I'm not perfect either! Hmm...
And I wake up, the end!
However, lately it's gotten pretty ridiculous!
Aww, sorry, I just saw one!
So get a job! Problem solved!
IT WAS ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD
It was a pretty great library!
It's not THAT weird, is it?
Hey, are we telling PROFESSION jokes?
Hah hah! Oh, those PROFESSION MEMBERS!
Okay! How about with "womanly characteristics"?
Why, Apparently, it's me - T-Rex!
I like this phrase, "pleasure calculus".
Wait... why do you need sugar?
Is this the face of exploitation?
Dude! INFINITE time. Things get CRAZY.
What's up, Champ? Something bothering you?
These guys are on the BALL!
THINGS T-REX DID THAT ONE TIME
ANSWERED THE PHONE IN THE NUDE:
Sociopaths view other people as obstacles.
Here's a question to ask myself:
I BRING YOU NUMEROUS GREETINGS T-REX
Aw man! What do you want?
T-That's actually a really interesting question!
It is a problem with me!
Well, I ate it. Problem solved!
This seems a little derivative, T-Rex!
Nope! It is 100% my creation!
Italics: IN MEMORY of GENE RODDENBERRY
Dromiceiomimus, how do you FEEL today?
Secretly, neither would I! High fives!!
How come you don't wear it?
I know you want to, Dromiceiomimus!
That's a little weird, but okay!
What the heck's your problem, T-Rex?
I wish I was never born!
You're still on about documentary film?
Yep.  T-That's what I think!
Today, I am selling compliments! 
Dromiceiomimus!  Give me a challenge!
Well, there's your problem, my friend!
Wait - you believe in racism?
How would it go disastrously wrong?
T-REX HAS DECIDED TO STALK SOMEONE:
Tonight is Hallowe'en, and that means...
... treats! Hooray! Hooray for treats!
I was like "Hah hah, what?"
Guy: Still making that lousy comic?
Ryan: Well, it's just a comic!
I think you are confused, T-Rex.
But there's no cure for cancer!
I think that's the whole point.
I have a possibly inappropriate question
Do you think it would work?
for ($i=0; $i<2; $i++) {print "$bologna{'name'}[$i]\n";}
You will symbolize change through repetition?
Oh, whatever. You look the same
NO DUDE. YOU ARE TOTALLY ALONE.
But that's not important right now!
It is, and you started it!
What is this emotion called 'regret'?
WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE FOOD DAY:
This story sounds pretty morbid, T-Rex!
Not that the cows could understand!
WE SKIP FORWARD TO T-REX'S DEATH:
The cells are called "helacyton gartleri".
Also: learning is not a competition?
You're becoming a generic stand-up comedian!
PEOPLE WHO DATE ONLY ASIANS COMICS
I regret never going white-water rafting!
And with that it becomes overused!
Some of them build cars, T-Rex.
Hah hah, sure thing!  Thanks!
I know I know but still!
I could give Dromiceiomimus my toaster!
They all had quite excellent names!
What are you saying that's original?
I will here nun of it!
I know!  IT'S SO WRONG.
LATER: THE FACE OF PRESCRIPTIVE LANGUAGE??
Well it probably wouldn't have worked.
WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO AGAIN
MAN! It almost happened just there!
What about things like EXTREME SNOWBOARDING?
That's okay! I have backup plans.
Where you be vegetarian for free?
It is a work in progress!
They support the entire food chain!
IT WILL ALL END IN HEARTBREAK
SO YEAH I HOPE THIS HELPS
I said, "quit stomping on things"!
Why are we talking about this?
Aww!  Shooting down my ideas?
Hah! I'd like to see that!
Dude! WE HAVE TO STEAL IT!
OH MAN WE SO HAVE TO
Hey, who are you talking to?
TIME TO FALL IN LOVE, EVERYONE
T-REX LET'S INVENT AN AGING MACHINE
Tada! The aging machine is completed!
Hey, do crying pills really exist?
You know, I have no idea!
IT'S FOR A PROJECT FOR SCHOOL.
I learnt a new phrase today!
In just the way you'd think!
BACK STORY: T-REX'S HOUSE IS MESSY?
That's not a very funny joke!
Skeleton: I'm really thirsty you guys
What a beautiful, crime-free, vigilante-filled day!
T-Rex, sshhh! Keep your voice down!
Indeed we would... Indeed we would.
AW MAN! Sucky dogs? POO bugs??
Man, that movie ROCKED, right guys?
The honest answer is "heck yes!"
Attractive Friend: Sounds like fun, guys!
It's time for some embarrassing stories!
LATER: T-REX TURNS UP THE CHARM!
Upon closer inspection, forget THAT noise!
So they're shaped like naughty bits?
BUT HOW TO PROFIT FROM IT?
That I have BLOWN PEOPLE'S MINDS??
Swirling maelstrom of dark energies: Check!
OR, absolutely the BEST thing ever??
Wait, you were seriously planning that?!
Actually I'm here to congratulate you.
T-REX AND FRIENDS DISCUSS: TR? L?V
Just a sec just a sec!
What makes you think this, T-Rex?
I got that from context, yeah.
I never knew that about him!
I've got my name picked out!
My bike will be called "Susan".
MAN. That's a good name too.
Let's hear it for reality, huh?
Does anyone truly own the internet?
I hear you want the internet?
GUYS THAT MOTHER WAS SO EXTREME!
I dreamt I was a cockfighter!
Hey!  You punch out turkeys?
{{label: LOG CABIN: REGRET INDEX .24}}
{{label: OUT-OF-SCALE CAR: REGRET INDEX .992}}
I, too, remain fully satisfied. 
Captain Jean-Luc Picard: "Make it so."
It all goes in the vault!
