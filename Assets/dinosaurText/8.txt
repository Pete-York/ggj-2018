I'll let history be the judge of that!
That's a pretty suspect saying, don't you think?
Then I'd cancel our bowling plans on Saturday!
Did you know that dogs and dinosaurs co-existed?
This is a very common fantasy among children!
"It was three years before the Great War!"
What if I said I'm not really kidding?
Alright, alright. Things I Need To Do Today:
Get dog food for my very angry dog!
LOGICAL FALLACY COMICS: today's fallacy: "THE STRAW MAN"
Yes, the woooorld, she revolves around me! (Probably!)
Whatever, man!  I'm getting OLDER and CHUBBIER.
Hey T-Rex, have you fed your dog yet?
MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE NOBODY EVER DIES:
Hah hah! I'm totally glad I invented it.
I HAVE AN INQUIRY TO POSE TO YOU
But putting up fliers for it around town?
Neighbour: YOU CAN SLEEP IN MY ROOM, T-REX.
Fine!  Let's look it up right now!
It'll work!  Don't be such a downer!
Wimpy guys talk about a lot of things!
Hah hah, oh man! Everyone's played Duck Hunt!
HA HA SERIOUSLY THOUGH WHAT IS IT LIKE
I FIND THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE QUITE HUMOROUS
Did you have anything to do with this?!
Dude!  Good thing I was around, eh?
And yet - bag of chips! Gender relations!
Maybe this isn't the best idea ever, T-Rex!
I have no one to blame but myself!
Let's settle this question once and for all!
Ooh, ouch.  Was that a bad pun?
I suspect that these are all bad puns!
Have I done anything worthwhile with my life?
T-Rex (thinking): I hope people like my bones!
And while "wif" meant female, "wer" meant male!
I'd lick my lips while I said, "Hello!"
THINGS TO DO WHILE WAITING IN AN AIRPORT
It's different when you do it! Sheesh! 
I think I'm becoming racist against taxi drivers!
I'm sorry we ever had a homosexual affair!
I could approximate some great works of fiction!
The days sure do go by so fast!
Have you ever met any asexual people, T-Rex?
This is a pretty dangerous topic, isn't it?
DROMICEIOMIMUS!  CAN WE SHOUT FOR A BIT
Well, soon the Batcave is getting pretty full!
Yeah, but it totally worked for a while!
What I have compiled is nothing less than...
I've got a good one for the list!
Well, then, I guess I'd face a choice!
DUDE WHY ARE YOU EVEN SAYING THIS THOUGH
Dromiceiomimus and I went to escape the heat!
Aw man! Maybe - maybe pretend you don't?
So sometimes I have these little secrets, yes?
Am I the only one with these problems?
D-Do people still talk about life management skills?
I don't feel anything different - do you?
I guess it's worth a try! On three!
It's a good thing gluttony isn't a sin!
Have you considered the meaning of your actions?
[[T-Rex's line in thought-bubble; partly obscures Utahraptor's screed]]
I think she raises a good point, T-Rex!
The news is, you make some convincing arguments!
Hah! Ouch for PROFESSION MEMBERS, and their stereotype!
I can't make  you dance, that's true!
Is there no way I can pay you?
They're "house parties" where anyone can show up!
LATER T-REX GOES OUT TO DINNER WITH FRIENDS:
(Thereby fulfilling the stereotype as I understand it!)
- our understanding of entropy could be wrong!
Another great secret is to call people "Champ".
TRIED TO HAVE A NAP IN THE SHOWER:
And guys I wasn't even trying that hard!
Hey! Careful with the cusses, Captain Cussy Pants!
Yes I just swore! I said - 
I don't want to hear it! No cussing!
T-REX AND THE DEVIL STAR IN: "ABANDONWARE ADVENTURES"
Oh, okay! I guess I do, a little.
My utopian society moved, Dromiceiomimus! They moved away!
What I do care about is vitamin B12!
... if only I knew more about it!
Do you have any problems with sexy stuffs?
Did you try them?  Did they work??
Does it really matter which idiolect you use?
I think you're exhausted and can't recognize it.
Are you jealous of my mutant dinosaur powers?
I think this is very symbolic for... something!
Oh, I'm just practicing.  How was I?
SERIOUSLY GUYS I HATE THOSE AD TRUCKS TOO
I LIKE TO DANCE IN MY UNDERPANTS T-REX
Utahraptor (off-panel): Aw man, that guy's a rube!
Hey, can I buy a compliment, T-REx? 
SUDDENLY YOU ARE NOT SUCH A GOOD DUDE.
What did you have for dinner last night?
TIME TO TELL PEOPLE SOME EMBARRASSING SECRETS T-REX
DUDE COME ON TELL PEOPLE YOUR EMBARRASSING SECRETS
Man! There's a reason adults don't go trick-or-treating!
Is it possible to have too many friends?
You know, talking like this risks backlash, T-Rex!
Yes indeed! I have decided to become AUTODIDACTIC.
Where'd you pick up a word like "autodidacticism"?
John Allison:  Nutrition: the opposite of extinction!
DINOSAUR TIP 1: TRICERATOPS LIKES WEEDS, DISLIKES GOOSEBERRIES
Ryan: It's the start of another awesome day!
The Race For The Cure must be stopped!
Is it a joke or a real question?
I carry my stress in my lower back.
Oh yeah? Well this next one represents you.
I am filled with my "Ordinarily Cautious Doubt"
Holy crap! There's a bomb in the comic.
If I stop stomping the comic will explode!
I must heroically continue to save us all!
Holy Crap, T-Rex! You just stomped that house!
I knew you were going to say that!
How did I know? You see that? Proof!
Hey T-Rex, why are you stomping that house?
... I really look forward to seeing him!
Sally Struthers, you should be ashamed of yourself!
I PROMISE ONLY FLAVOURED CHIPS AND HIGH ADVENTURE
I don't - why are you asking this?
Then they rub their faces on the carpet.
That's okay, Morris!  Everyone gets confused sometimes!
I'm going to ignore the symbolism of this!
Everyone! Support the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol!
Besides, nothing says "cultured" like playing the piano!
No, I feel I can do both. 
So what's the story with this drug research?
But it's okay, because everyone hates racists, right?
As a matter of fact, yes, you do!
God, you ove me several sub-themed items too!
HOLY SHIT WHY DOES EVERYONE KEEP SAYING THAT
This will consummate my social ruin FOR SURE!
Plus it wouldn't even get used that often!
Except for the kids who are born male.
Is the entire script based on computer puns?
I'm not giving you double high fives, T-Rex.
MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE EVERYONE SNOWBOARDS EVERYWHERE:
What I do care about is vitamin B12!
Beef liver, fish, eggs, and milk, among others.
Dating both twin sisters at the same time:
Hot? Or just, in fact, KIND OF WEIRD?
I really don't see how you're getting this!
What's not to get? Twins! Proxies! Transitive closure!
That strikes me as an odd analogy, T-Rex!
People have worried about this before, my friend!
Yes. On account of the golly gosh-darned scurvy.
Something like, "T-Rex: Your Man In ANY Situation!"
"T-Rex: Not A Pedophile (Just So You Know)"?
How about "T-Rex: Your Shortcomings and Regrets, Personified!"
That's even less positive than the first one!!
I HAVE LONG SINCE STOPPED SOLICITING SUGGESTIONS, UTAHRAPTOR.
Thank you T-Rex. You're not so bad yourself.
What, you're going to shoot down my idea?
Even sunflowers? They tilt to follow the sun!
You got sick a few months ago, remember?
NEXT TIME, ON DINOSAUR COMICS: SOME UNEXPECTED SUCCESS.
T-Rex - I don't think it's working out.
a comic to solve all your emotional problems
ANYWAY, T-REX ENDS UP SPENDING VALENTINE'S DAY ALONE:
Just to keep the friendship interesting, you understand.
Time to start practicing! Say something to me.
What's that? I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention!
What's that? I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention!
Like everything I've EVER DONE WRONG OH GOD
Aw MAN! Dromiceiomimus wins the regret competition AGAIN!!
So I hear you're having a minuswomb operation?
Off-panel stranger: Excuse me? I'm having a hysterectomy.
Today: Origin of the dinosaur Comics, part I
So let's hear what you've written so far!
Okay, but I warn you: it is unfinished.
That's actually way better than the last one.
Whoa, not everyone needs to fall in love!
A MACHINE THAT MAKES PEOPLE AGE REAL FAST
I've never been moved to tears by music!
This has actually been done before, my friend!
Today: Origin of the dinosaur comics, part ][
Exactly! We hedge our bet by having friends!
Someone: The special is chicken masala with rice.
Yep! That would be the end of you!
Are you saying what I think you're saying?!
Nobody must ever find out my AWESOME SECRET!
Well, that should throw her off the trail!
None that I feel comfortable telling right now!
And maybe UTAHRAPTOR will have some embarrassing stories!
It's true! Huh! Thanks for the advice, Dromiceiomimus.
Oh man, a sunset!  Boo hoo hoo!
Do people HAVE to choose a gender roll?
Ha! I have made a hilarious typographic error!
GREETINGS T-REX ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH SPEED RUNS
So this is like a skill people develop?
Today: Origin of the dinosaur comics, part IV
Sleeping with the window open still rules, though!
What symbolism? They just show that you care!
I CAN NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY THOSE PLANS.
My God, is that what "chat up" means?!
Right! There are some tough and sm
