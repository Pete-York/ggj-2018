OH MY GOODNESS HOW DID WE JUST DO THAT
A VAST MERCILESS HELL OF PERMANENT AND IMMEDIATE DANGER
Optometrist Clerk: Sir, you have made an unforgettable choice.
Second on the list: "alluring"! followed closely by "stompin'"!
Sometimes we do, Dromiceiomimus. BETWEEN ROCK SONGS, THAT IS!!
Utahraptor! I'm super late for rocking out practice, okay?
I'm gonna need you to respect the rock, okay?
Off-panel: Save us! Save us from the zombie butterflies!
Aw, Morris! You don't look very undead to me!
It's not too late to return it, Morris! 
Guys, I'm still the same T-Rex I always was!
HERE'S THE ONE TIME T-REX EVER SAYS THAT SENTENCE:
I am not a dude who loves big companies.
Beginning with the most modest: why am I here?
Book Fair Seller: UM, THAT'S WHY I'M SELLING IT
Good! Hey, would you say I smell... "entirely acceptable"?
Oh, that's easy then. You're coming on to me.
Still just ask him about science stuff though, okay?
Aww! You must have been such a cute kid!
I could call up old girl-friends and act familiar!
Maybe there's still hope though! Turn to panel 4.
{{ thought bubble }} WHO THE HECK SAID THAT?!
How many religions have you started so far, T-Rex?
So much for the timelessness of art, HUH ARTISTS??
Is it nothing more than a convenience, a mere-
Hi there, T-Rex! What's nothing more than a convenience?
Utahraptor!  I have an important announcement to make!
Okay even I think that one's not so good.
also i don't really like the taste of alcohol
Technofan:  Hey,  our terrible techno music stopped!
I really wish I still knew someone named Beth.
I would make SO MANY jokes about her name!
Enough of these high-school "does she like me?" shenanigans!
Oh! Yeah, it was nice. We had "chai" tea.
Yeah, or what if one of us is dead?
And how come bad things happen to nice people?!
September is coming, and that means BACK TO SCHOOL!
And then he gets shot by a random criminal!
SO MY QUESTION TO THAT IS WHAT'S THE DEAL
Yeah, the Dromiceiomimus and I played, two nights ago.
Hey, are we writing "thanks for the sex" cards?
Dromiceiomimus! I can throw my voice! Check it out!
Okay in this story I'm a computer called Multivac!
Will there ever be a way to do that?
Man! Dromiceiomimus is crazy. I've done tons of stuff!
Island gigantism is a pretty okay form of evolution.
T-Rex, aren't you being - ah, kind of racist?
We could find out more at our local library!
EPILOGUE: A FEW DAYS LATER, T-REX CALLS HIS GRANDMOTHER.
Movie Poster Text: "Five stars"#8230;out of a possible FOUR!"
Movie Poster Text: "I liked all the jump cuts"
It's going to be one HECK of a novelization.
This one is all, "Well, it's true for me!"
Voice: Hey, T-Rex! This ice cream cake is delicious!
Thanks! Don't you think it tastes like... philosophical compromise?
Um, I would like to know too much, please!
Here are some things you can say to that!
But where are you going to get a skeleton?
Mr. Tusks: I think they're a...TINY bit awesome, T-Rex!
Mr. Tusks...are you just saying that for the pun?
You have difficulty discerning to whom I am speaking!
I know! Should you laugh... OR RUN IN TERROR?
I don't know, T-Rex! Why DON'T bats live alone?
Because they prefer to hang out with their friends!
Don't bother showing up to my dinner party, HOMOPHONES.
But are there really a lot of these words?
T-REX HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF HOMOGRAPHIC HOMOPHONIC AUTANTONYMS
Probably because we want it to be incredibly awesome?
How come you love words that make communication difficult?
Book Cover Text: Personality-Wise?  Maybe It's Your Body.
Book Cover Text: YOUR BODY NO LONGER EXCITES HER
Um, why don't you talk to him about it?
LET'S ALL TAKE STOCK OF THE PAST WEEK COMICS
Not bad! I wish I could have tried it!
So this homeless guy asked me for change yesterday.
Want to come over for some "chai" tea? 
'We need leaders who actually understand technology,' muttered Amelia!
Well, you're making people happy, and that's something, right?
Wow, so people really liked it! You're a celebrity!
So maybe they DON'T like it for the sex!
YOU ARE HAVING AN ELEPHANT OF A GOOD TIME.
Whale Watcher: You know what? I think I am!
I don't get why you're so interested in this!
Off-panel: THERE'S A REASON WE KEEP THEM SEPARATED, EVERYONE
I don't see why you're making fun of Doug!
Yeah, but chap, you know what I don't say?
T-Rex's thoughts: I COULD USE THIS IN MY ACT.
I'm just saying!  It would be the worst.
Sorry? Could your vocal chords and mouth repeat that?
SITUATIONS IN WHICH TO USE "THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!"
Stage Right: This is the line for the bathroom!
So - you're saying there is no punch line?
What did the depressed snowman say to his dog?
Why yes, as a matter of fact I -
And so this is your ultimate story for kids?
Child (off screen): They unsettle us all, I know.
Person 3: See, I have a lot of sex.
AMAZING AND TRUE STORIES FROM THE LIFE OF UTAHRAPTOR
T-Rex (thinking): I'm still thinking about Chris P. Bacon
T-Rex's thought bubble: I hate being reminded of Zach.
She can avoid falling pianos and win the lottery.
Oh wow, is that a quarter on the ground?
T-Rex (thought bubble): How old am I?  27?
Off Panel: There's a boxing kangaroo at the circus.
This provides an opportunity for AMPLE PRANKS of HILARITY.
Off-panel: It smells like gas and corpses in here.
WHAT YOUNG T-REX THINKS ADULT LIFE WILL BE LIKE:
WHAT TEEN T-REX THINKS ADULT LIFE WILL BE LIKE:
"Colonize what you explore, but explore what you colonize."
See, why didn't I ever say that to YOU?
I've never worked retail! How bad could it be?
He said it after he invented satellites, I KNOW
I actually know a woman who has synesthesia, T-Rex!
T-Rex's Mental Text: Do I want to go swimming?
T-Rex's Mental Text: Do I want to go swimming?
Folks will know all of my embarrassing little SECRETS.
I feel like you haven't thought this out, T-Rex.
Here's a solution to that!  DON'T FALL DOWN??
Why not come onto my lawn for a second
So the Utahraptor's playing Science to my Religion, eh?
So the Utahraptor's playing Science to my Religion, eh?
Give it to a museum, T-Rex! They'll take it!
The next sequel could be a road trip movie!
They're talking to a GIRL, T-Rex, not each other!
COMPRESSED SONG COMICS "SURF CITY" BY THE BEACH BOYS
Okay, honestly, who wants to hear about Nazi pins?
It's because I am trying to live in CARTOONS.

I don't know what to tell you, my friend!
What? No, I never said that! It's not true!!
Unreliable Narrator: AGE 30: KISSING BUMS ON HIS ELBOWS
I must request that you give me a break!
I don't think you'd fit on a giraffe, T-Rex.
Tattoo Artist: And you PROMISE you won't regret this?
See?  I don't even know who you are!
(whispering) i'm a dromiceiomimus pretending to be a t-rex
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ACTUALLY USED "ALACK" LIKE THAT
I know where you could find a beach ball!
I know where you could find a beach ball!
Hey.  That was a lot of acronyms there.
T-Rex (thinking): I still think your name's rad though
This still sounds like an elaborate excuse for plagiarisms!
HI! HERE'S SOME THINGS THAT COULD GO WRONG TODAY!
The result of this is a proliferation of stereotypes!
Don't tell me you're planning to become prematurely old.
Comics are words or images juxtaposed in deliberate sequence!
Um, you're not supposed to speak during tableau, T-Rex!
It looks like YOU'VE got the wrong friggin' guy!!
DIFFERENT WAYS TO TELL SOMEONE THEY ARE WRONG COMICS
This is not the first time this has happened!
The Devil: IT REMAINS SOME OF MY FINEST WORK
You really can't get past your opinion on dreams?
Passer By 3: I really want to hear more!!
What's wrong with "He's at peace"?  It's nice.
An example! Dromiceiomimus, you've got a very pretty body!
If you don't have any trains around, that is!!
WELL THEN. I GUESS I'M A FAN OF HORSES.
Personally, I'm just flattered you're hanging out with us!
Yeah, the evidence against you does look pretty bad!
T-Rex, have you seen my couch? It's gone missing!
But they DO prevent spur of the moment suicides!
I know, I know. IT'S NOT LIKE SUMMONING BEETLEJUICE.
I think your problem is you're focusing on plot!
Truly, I am the epitome of the male form!
Okay, I am writing ROMANCE here.  No sex!
A FEW DAYS LATER, T-REX MEETS A ZOMBIE GHOST!
T-Rex and Utahraptor: Zombies don't even have lightning powers!
Voice: Also the atomic bomb being dropped on you.
The course of my life has now been set!
NO, BUT MY POINT IS YOU PUNCTUATED THAT IMPROPERLY
T-Rex [thinks]: Secretly, I did punctuate that sentence improperly!
It is so bad, T-Rex! Fascism is bad news!!
Today I'm going to play by my own rules!
Mr. Tusks: T-Rex I am also a vice mayor
This is not the person I thought I was!
Screw it!! I'm gonna talk to him, right now!
Maybe you should give up your ego here, T-Rex!
It's called "setting up a spinoff"; look it up?
Saying "We declare war" is the same, isn't it?
Look, sorry for admitting I was wrong, I guess?
I'M ANGRY BUT I THINK IT'S GONNA BE AWESOME
It was a century of kids outcooling their parents!
I feel very oddly about dead dogs right now
I tried that, but every theme is taken too!
The "Coso Artefact" wasn't found in a geode, T-Rex!
Excuse me, stunt driver? Are YOU afraid of death?
Guys! We totally need a new analogy for sex!
Who can forget the events of July 30, 2215?
Who can forget the events of July 30, 2215?
T-Rex off-panel: I still say "dick" in the future?
So! Did you read my rewrite of your comic?
T-Rex's comic: TINA, THE DUDE WHO PUNCHED THE FUTURE
He slash she should just address the issues directly!
It's time to live this day... TO THE MAX!
Once upon a time there was a radical guy!
I still think there could be One Perfect Song!
Well! I guess I'd better get to work, huh?
Whatever, man! Bears do it, and everybody likes bears!
It interferes with my ability to enjoy the show!
You can't put the genie back in the bottle!
Hiccuping forever is this weird sort of... forced immortality!
Okay, so go to that. Choose your own adventure.
I suppose. I'm still not comfortable with the name!
But sometimes these objects are found with human remains!
But you've said WAY more than two lines,my friend!
So what meaning do you see my action representing?
Twenty seconds later, the longstanding friendship was over. 
LATER: THEY DO NOT KEEP UP WITH EACH OTHER
YES I KNOW IT IS AMAZING TO THINK OF
PLUS T REX THIS IS LIKE THE THIRD TIME.
You will stomp nicely, young woman!  Good show!
Well, I can't say that I follow you T-Rex
Well - by "book" I really meant "T.V. show".
A FEW WEEKS LATER, T-REX GETS HONKED AT AGAIN:
So let's just multiply everyone's vote by their informedness!
We did.  By God, we did.  
Gentlemen, ladies: calm down please!  It was me!!
So, hey, your euphemisms are pretty weak so far!
Aw, really? All at once or in li'l bites?
Here are some simple ways to improve your life!
Maybe you should stop being such a CRAZY RACIST??
I'd like to know where you buy your plays.
Instantly the ground he's standing on transforms into gold!
My friends, I have the solution: The T-Rex system!
One in seven Canadians is living with a disability!
THIS COMIC IS DEDICATED TO ONE IN SEVEN CANADIANS
Excuse me, God!  What's being a ghost like?
LISTEN ANOTHER DIFFERENCE IS THAT I CAN CREATE UNIVERSES
So I got the link you emailed me, T-Rex!
YES THEY ARE STILL PUTTING DAFFY DUCK ON MUGS
Is it wrong to want things that are terrible?
But M-W will obviously choose words in the dictionary!
See? I couldn't find "sexplosive", "mathemagician", "backne" OR "ambisextrous"!
Utahraptor! No one has ever said that about "ambisextrous".
And this is PROBABLY why sexin' is fun times!
So you think you're not actually a good person!
I wear them when I'm a relationship counsellor, silly!
T-Rex [[thinking]]: I am drumming up business for myself
T-REX IS GETTING HIS OUT OF THE WAY EARLY.
Time for a severe non-penetrative blow to the head!
All funny t-shirts use the same unmodified t-shirt canvas:
What happens to ME when I die? Me. Myself!
Looks like this Thursday morning just got filled up!!
Because dudes, the Earth is spinning on its axis!
Adults can pilot helicopters, but also can marry poorly!
[[Thinking]] No-one must know I peed on the wall
And I wish you wouldn't interrupt my sexualizin', Utahraptor!!
Plot twists don't always happen at the end, though!
Guess who's two hundred years old today? Charles Darwin!
...Um, I'm actually not really sure why I'm here?
I don't know. . . it just feels right.
But can someone who's destroying beauty truly appreciate it?
Things are going pretty well for you, my friend!
But how much particle displacement happens at conversational levels?
It doesn't count if you're just spitting on me
T-Rext: ... or should I say - ACTUALLY EXISTED??
... It's not the guy I made up, though.
Man! Friggin' English friggin' lets me down friggin' again!!
Shoot! I forgot to have a shower this morning!
Sure! I'd love to come to your dinner party!
And that brings us to method one: online dating!
If they do, they're not doing it around me!
I would tell you it's been a rousing success!!
YES ITS PRECISE MEANING WILL FOREVER REMAIN A MYSTERY
Okay, but they've probably both felt this way berfore.
I'm pretty sure it was to avoid these talks!!
I'm pretty sure it was to avoid these talks!!
What happens if you don't eat any fried chicken!
"Have confidence in this certainty: things will be alright."
...of the sexual histories of friends and acquaintances, PERHAPS??
DINOSAUR COMICS ASKS: HOW IS TODAY SPECIAL FOR YOU?
Today is special because we're all healthy and happy!
Honestly! Sometimes I wonder how I'm not more famous!
Actually Shakespeare did write some pretty terrible stuff, T-Rex!
Actually Shakespeare did write some pretty terrible stuff, T-Rex!
...Seriously ready to evolve any time now over here!
T-REX WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR OBITUARY TO SAY
Time for me to start counting my friggin' calories!
It's a measurement of h- how fat you'll get?
It doesn't make you "weak" to have allergies, T-Rex!
Writing is hard, but THAT is an excellent start!
Hey, guys! It's time for the incorrigible adventures of...
But you said you were confirming an initial suspicion.
Man, you weren't really gone for a full week!
Tattoo Artist: Sir, we only tattoo skin, not bones.
Heck, I'm not busy.  Let's go right now!
Heck, I'm not busy.  Let's go right now!
How are you going to pull this off, T-Rex?
Okay, but what about emails and other online communication?
How's the Tic Tac Toe coming along, Superintelligent AI?
I could give you some tips if you want!
Like what? "Tasty-times"? "It's time for some tasty-times breakfast"?
I know a handful of justifications for doing this!
T-Rex + Utahraptor: Who the hell goes to Cornwall?
Folks just want to tell increasingly awesome stories! 
I figure - supporting character in an historical drama?
Wow, these jokes are kinda mean to PROFESSION MEMBERS!
Utahraptor the Utahraptor. How'd you get such a name?
My parents gave it to me T-Rex the Tyrannosauroid.
You'd also need total surveillance recording your every utterance!
Why not? Why not? I'll tell you why not!!
What? I never got to go on my adventure?
HEY T-REX DO YOU BELIEVE MONEY MAKES PEOPLE HAPPIER
Mo' money CAN, apparently, indeed lead to mo' problems.
THERE'S NO NEED TO DO SCIENCE ON DEPRESSED DUDES
SOMETIMES LIFE IS HARD FOR YOU ISN'T IT T-REX
...Oh wait nevermind it's hard at other times too
Hah! I mean, "some of THOSE books of quotations"!
Also, we'll still have some of the old problems.
So, you want to sound like Cary Grant, eh?
YOU NEED TO HAVE YOUR MIND BLOWN NOW OKAY
And I TOTALLY haven't paid it back yet, either!
You want to be the first murderer in space?
Is it murder if you're literally asking for it?
And when you woke up you remembered that moral!
It was an exciting time to be saying "Forsooth"!
Today is a good day I think for revenge!
But my mom says I should be a witch
Only because I always reserve point five for emergencies!!
Only because I always reserve point five for emergencies!!
It's not! I added in some NARRATIVE TENSION too!
It's not! I added in some NARRATIVE TENSION too!
The serfs certainly dropped the ball on that one!
Therefore ours is the worst of all possible worlds?
Today is a good day I think for leitwortstil!
Hey T-Rex, why are you dressed up so fancy?
I set 'em up, future generations knock 'em down!
No, I think that movie's been referenced enough lately
LISTEN I DIDN'T MEAN FOR THAT TO BE SEXIST
LISTEN I DIDN'T MEAN FOR THAT TO BE SEXIST
NOTE FOR FUTURE PEOPLE WHO COME ACROSS THIS COMIC:
HEY T-REX YOU KINDA SHOULDN'T TEASE PEOPLE WITH TATTOOS
Um, according to some religions, GOD CAN DO ANYTHING??
I know, IT SOUNDS CRAZY, but stay with me!
"That's the last time I'm puking into my crotch"?
I decided I wanted life to have some mystery.
I'm totally going to fake my own death today.
We're doing this, man.  We're making this happen.
What's that, computer? Updates are available to be installed?
Maybe something that used to work won't work anymore!
Oh frig! I think the future just got awesome!
I think it's happening to me! Waterpark, waterpark, waterpark.
YEP FOR SURE I LOVE TO EAT MY CREATIONS
And it has worked out really well so far!
Oh my God, this radio station sucks so bad!!
Wow, when did you become an old man, T-Rex?
I'm so tired of all my actions having consequences!
Raccoons and cephalopods: YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO KNOW
Raccoons and cephalopods: SOME OF THE ORGANS ARE FULL
Raccoons and cephalopods: YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO KNOW
Raccoons and cephalopods: SOME OF THE ORGANS ARE FULL
I too represent nature, but rather its nurturing aspect!
Chef, off-panel: Patrons who don't barge into the kitchen?
Morris, I guess sometimes your problems really ARE difficult!
It's just I'm - I'm pretty sure we do.
That - that normally ends the conversation right there
What day is it? It's December now, isn't it?
Hey. Hey! You have something stuck between your teeth!
Alright! Life itself is, what - like twenty bucks?
Hell, I'm a monster and you're bigger than ME!
Okay, so, turns out I might be dead someday.
I, uh, don't see any future generations listening in.
I thought you were taking notes! Where's your notepad?!
Nobody tell them HTML doesn't work like that, okay??
Some of it probably got turned into your body!
This is depressing, let's talk about poo atoms again!
Man!  I take it back, dying is AWESOME.
With this in mind, I have created... the Nutrinomicon!
I have to admit, your name is cooler, though.
I propose we call this emotion: HUGGA BUBBA LOVE
Okay, so maybe "hugga bubba" ISN'T the best adjective.
Except Shakespeare did most of his writing before dictionaries!
So I was TOTALLY partially right!  That's EXCELLENT.
DINOSAUR COMICS WISHES YOU A HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS 2010
When you spend your time talking to a T-Rex...
PEOPLE WHO QUOTE OTHER PEOPLE ALL THE TIME COMICS
Um, why do you think you're a genius, T-Rex?
I'm glad I keep these little fantasies to myself!
What if people can't tell when I'm being sarcastic?
You shut up! Don't try to push me around!
Computational linguistics is the study of computer-based language processing!
I know!  We'll get to see them KISS!
Oh yeah! But there's still cake for us, right?
Utahrapper: Yo, I thought I was just getting bigger!
Yeah, at once! It was awesome! I have pictures!
<<S T O M P>> [[T-Rex stomps the house]]
Relationships take time and effort. They can't happen overnight.
Perhaps I will not eat my friends after all!
[[Thought-bubble begins here; emanating from Utahraptor in panel 5]]
I just bet I do this because I'm bored!
I didn't know today was your birthday! Happy birthday!
Wow... Grandfather sure knows how to throw a party!
Oh yeah?  What are you dressing up as?
Maybe I'll dress up for Hallowe'en as a Utahraptor!
Man.  Well, here's what you have to do...
I can't help it if I can't remember it!
        a
I am the strapping young T-Rex stomping on things!
Can you get mom to wear her pearl necklace?
I must guard against such self-absorption in the future!
Yeah! Yeah, that's right! It doesn't work on yellow.
Today's origin story: THE PHRASE "BALLS TO THE WALL"
Why don't you tell me what you really think?
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
For instance: "The horse raced past the barn fell"!
Yeah, I guess you could see it that way.
Sure! I'll bake a delicious pumpkin pie for dessert!
American Thanksgiving is similar, but distinct, from regular Thanksgiving.

However, when I arrived, they were out of tickets!
How can a one-day-old holiday have a true spirit?
That's the magic of Dinosaur Present Day, Featuring T-Rex!
I just like the excitement of giving people presents!
It makes me feel kind of sexy, you know?
Thank you so much for the little gloves, Dromiceiomimus!
Featuring T-Rex? That would be a lot of presents!
Hmm... is this a riddle? Is the answer "longest"?
Hmm... is this a riddle? Is the answer "longest"?
Then I guess my career as an educator is...
Two dinosaurs would make more noise than one dinosaur.
Ok tweens, I'll be your substitute teacher for today!
You're not writing to another teen magazine, are you?
WHAT'S THE CUTEST PHRASE YOU CAN COME UP WITH?
There's no way that would work, T-Rex! No way!
Yes, there are many differences between adults and children!
What? No! I don't have cooties! Nobody has cooties!
Is there some political undertone to what you're saying?!
Cybernetic Collective Consciousness: We tell it like it is!
Yep! It's HOT, if I do say so myself!
How is it that I have the same dream...
I'm afraid your reasoning is flawed T-Rex! Fatally flawed!
Hey, T-Rex! I wanted to ask you a question!
So what meaning do you see my actions representing?
I have been thinking of registering a domain name...
It did? Oh, I am so scared of dinosaurs!!
Here is a list of things that I've burnt:

This is once race you're going to lose, T-Rex!
Sure! Although I've not heard much of your poetry!
The End, by T-Rex, ps: my soul is chaos!
It's a stupid fantasy! It doesn't even make sense!
What are you talking about? My arms are powerhouses!
Hey T-Rex, I left some music at your house!
Imagine if it had vocals! And a drum solo!
Yesterday was a very special day for many people!
You're moving with your Auntie and Uncle in Bel-Air!
Okay, so who wants to join my bluegrass band?
Dromiceiomimus, how come you never send me any emails?
You'd get more emails if you sent more out!
Dromiceiomimus, how come you never send me any emails?
You'd get more emails if you sent more out!
Oh boy, a science demonstration! What's this, a spider?
BUT... WHAT IF THE T-REX HADN'T BEEN SO RESTRAINED?
I note that it is certainly windy out today.
Dromiceiomimus, want to go fly a kite with me?
Best garden ever, if I do say so myself!
There you are! I need my gardening shovel back.

It's cool to do two non-gender-identified people at once.
Um, that's right. I was thinking of something else.
By being true to yourself, you are forever derivative!
Really! So I'm talking to the new improved T-Rex?
WHAT IF... SELF IMPROVEMENT REALLY WAS A TRIVIA CONTEST?
YOU KNOW JUST CHECKING IN WITH MY MAIN MAN
I am forced to disagree with you, my friend!
So copyright las is in a state of self-contradiction!
(Even though it is the classy thing to do!)
I like my women like I like my cars!
I like my women like I like my cars!
And, I've learned my lesson: always listen to others!
Alternate Utahraptor: I am the same Utahraptor as always!
Whoever sent this to you thinks you are great!
No, that's wrong. I taught you the dance moves.
I could also contribute to a discussion re: philosophy.
IT'S A PARTY IN THIS COMIC AND EVERYONE'S INVITED
Well, let's be glad no such person exists then!
Yes, from any given perspective there is no change!
It's spooky! It says so in the first sentence!
LATER T-REX GIVES A READING OF HIS NEW BOOK:
Certainly! But I warn you: a school burning down?
HA HA T-REX YOU SURE HAVE SOME CRAZY FRIENDS
It seems like a really crappy ending to me!
Goodbye, Evil T-Rex! I'm returning to my own Universe!
If there's one thing you know, it's not women!
I named him, "The Angriest Dog In The World".
Dromiceiomimus, what's your opinion on people who are naked?
Dromiceiomimus, what's your opinion on people who are naked?
So a friend of mine got a cell phone!
I lived in your house while you were gone!
Congratulations on publishing a book of your story, T-Rex!
T-Rex, it's just a daydream! Don't worry about it.
Hey! It's MY sex advice show! Get your own!
Well, there are valid and invalid generalizations, my friend!
Well what's the stereotype that applies to you T-Rex?
Indeedy! Now everything I say will be the truth!
The path to enlightenment is truly through homemade drugs!
Brightly coloured fall leaves, being gently covered in snow!
Because that would be plagiarism, and plagiarism is wrong!
With this in mind, I'm going for a walk!
That's good, but this definition seems a little unnecessary!
LATER: EVERYONE GETS INVITED TO A WEDDING EXCEPT T-REX.
Okay, you've lost me: how is wasting food manly?
(Where "we" refers to the general population, of course!)
(Science means that not all dreams can come true!)
Man, I've always wanted to travel to the future!
Aw, no, no! Not that teen magazine idea again!
Aw, no, no! Not that teen magazine idea again!
Yay! The T-Rex is here! I love you, T-Rex!
Time to STOMP ON THIS HOUSE - Quebec style!

Replaced! Replaced with a healthy respect for the ENVIRONMENT.
It's common knowledge who said it! Sheesh! GEORGE SANTAYANA.
Well, you won't fool me! I know the stereotypes!
But not all arctic exploration ends in cannibalism, T-Rex!

A FAILED EXPERIMENT HAS CAUSED TIME TO BECOME UNGLUED!
CAN NOTHING BE DONE TO RESTORE THE NATURAL ORDER?
Maybe ADJECTIVES wouldn't force us to have such conversations!
I USUALLY DON'T PUT A NEW BAG BACK EITHER
I guess there's consequences to breaking confidences, eh T-Rex?
So you want "natural" dialogues in your constructed fictions?
Man, you've got your own personal theology going, eh?
Wow, you sure got shot down there, my friend!
I guess this is how rumours get started, huh?
I had a friend once who joined a sorority.
"At least I don't have to buy my friends!"
Wow, I had no idea you were so fascist!
Sounds like a fine line to me, my friend!
At least he's not tricking you for your soul!
I'm sure I have no idea what you're tal-
OUR STORY TAKES A SUDDEN DIVE... INTO GRAMMATICAL SCRUTINY!
I also need a new PUMP for my tires.
DANCING LADIES AND TASTY SNACKS SUDDENLY APPEAR JUST OFFSCREEN:
That's exactly how I feel! You've articulated it perfectly.
Isn't that kind of a jerky thing to do?
Oh! Oh man - that is an awful joke!
BUT YOU AGREE IT'S AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENT THOUGH RIGHT
Wow, I thought you'd never finish fighting those ninjas!
Space Rex: Do you hear it, my trusted sidekick?
Professor Utiarty: I can steal your goggles, Space Rex!
And their hands - their little, nimble, probing hands!
Cephalopod and raccoon neighbours, I respect your unique worldview!
It's true!! They could just pop out like CRAZY.
I've changed my mind!  You know what's great?
I guess so. Anyway! Let's go play TOUCH FOOTBALL!
I feel alot better about the whole thing now.
Time to go and get some HEARTY MAN SLEEP!
"It's too bad you never go married, eh?" 
Woo! Looks like my day just got filled up!
Imagine my dismay at coming to such a realization!
BUT T-REX FORGETS TO WRITE FOR LIKE THREE MONTHS:
What? It's not excellent, T-Rex! It's bad argument technique!
But aren't some LVCs more acceptable than others? 
I'm not as skinny as I used to be!
You both are crazy, and you both look fine!
I've got to remember to feed my pet dog!
Actually, I might go up north for a bit.
God damn it! Can you believe I forgot again?
Excuse me! Unmotivated people? I'm T-Rex, your motivational speaker!
Sure, borrow my four-seater rocket car whenever you want!
Wow, people are going to think you're an ass!
Perhaps! But still, my style will be totally CRAMPED.
(Second base in the sexually euphemistic sense, of course!)
I find these bases to be highly improbably, Dromiceiomimus!
That thing is the ability to feel physical pleasure!
HEY T-REX DO YOU KNOW WHERE WIND COMES FROM
I CAN NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY THESE SCURRILOUS ALLEGATIONS
HOWEVER I DO CONFESS TO ACHIEVING UPWARDS OF 
For example: "Chim chimi chang chim chimi chang chimichangas!"
it works really well with songs from Mary Poppins
Let us talk today about a very important topic:
But maybe it is! What could possibly go wrong?
THIS LEADS TO SEVERAL MUTUALLY-SATISFACTORY, CONSEQUENCE-FREE MAKEOUTS WITH EX-GIRLFRIENDS:
Well, what do you mean by knowledge being innate?
Oh ho, I'm sorry, is it BITCHY in here?
An interesting distinction, if I do say so myself!
I suspect that you have, because it's totally true!
Are you worried that you sound a little creepy?
In other news, being cognizant is so totally sweet!
Hey, what do you have against singer/poetsmith Leonard Cohen?
There's a lot you don't know about semiconductors, too!
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY HARD AND KIND OF GROSS:
My dog ran away by his own free will!
Go on, imagine it as hard as you can!
Maybe you should find out what she's upset about?
Hey, I got my pictures developed, by the way!
Also, in Canada? Two chicks can totally get married!
Okay, so Gotham City is infected with zombies, right?
So phlogiston would have to have a negative mass!
Wow, you really seem to care about copyright laws!
Hee hee! It's a good day to be T-Rex!
I submit that it would be pretty okay indeed!
I agree!! I am a model for us all.
A FEW DAYS LATER THE RASH GETS WORSE: 
The revolution has ended due to lack of interest!
Maybe you shouldn't keep so many secrets then, T-Rex!
But baby, I've got a good feeling about today!
Your idea of childhood is chasing after animals naked?
There's no shame in that! I do everything naked!
Yeah man! In such a universe, science totally fails!
None other than a manliness contest!  Heck yes!
Oh! Why don't PROFESSION MEMBERS play hide and seek?
Probably I just want to make things more interesting!
It's a pretense for a scene of cooking-themed sex.
PUSHED SOMEONE DOWN A SLIDE BEFORE THEY WERE READY:
What mde you think that was a good idea?
But you sort of blame the baby though, right?
AND A QUESTION I WISH TO POSE TO YOU
But - you're a guy! ... AREN'T YOU? 
Hey did I overhear that we're talking about feelings?
You're sure using a lot of qualifiers there, T-Rex!
Hmmm... they tasted like regular meat sticks, I guess!
A BEANIE CAP WITH A GLOW-IN-THE-DARK PROPELLER ON TOP:
T-Rex (whisper): Also I think I broke the propeller.
IT IS DIFFICULT TO TELL WHERE THE TRUTH LIES
YES WELL THAT'S WHY I INVENTED THE PLACE T-REX
Count me in too! What could possibly go wrong?
T-REX STAYS UP FOR 41 HOURS IN THIS COMIC:
What's it like being awake for over a day?
Last night I ate lots of pears by mistake.
Off-panel (whisper): can you tell people about me though
Oh man, those ad trucks piss ME off too!
T-Res: Then why don't you do anything about it?
THE UNIVERSE WHERE EVERYONE GOES TO CLASS BUT T-REX:
Okay! What can I get for one dollar? 
How slight a difference are we talking about here?
Specifically, trapdoor functions are SUPER interesting!  Times two!
But all you're getting is one secret, no more!
I already sent it out over the news wires!
RIGHT.  We are NOT allowed to murder him.
Are you - you're going trick-or-treating this year, T-Rex?
What? But it's barely November. You're planning this now?
Nobody can kiss me today, because I'm sick. 
That's alright - I'm sure I'll survive somehow. 
John Allison:  Knock knock, a visitor has arrived!
John Allison:  Dessert is important.  Never forget.
A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MR. RYAN NORTH
Ryan: Whoever said comics have to mirror real life?
I'll say I am! Who are these creeps, anyway?
Hey T-Rex! I know what's going to happen too!
Oh yeah?? Well... I... predict that you're a stupid!
Hey, you know what I don't like anymore? STOMPING.
It's so overdone.  I no longer enjoy STOMPING.
Bill Cosby is the greatest actor of all time!
But T-Rex, crushing things isn't fundamentally altering our universe.
He must have been talking to someone behind me.
By which I mean "examining instinctual responses", of course!
I'm not going to hell just to play RPGs!
Dear lottery officials: I would not have such troubles!
These events only serve to further undermine my credibility!
We - we was being straight out socially irresponsible.
HEY T-REX HAVE YOU EVER PULLED ANY SWEET PRANKS
Pranks are supposed to end in laughter all around?
Do you have any science questions you'd like answered?
Dromiceiomimus?  Have YOU ever done any consciousness-altering drugs?
Didn't the grocery store have a parking lot, Morris?
Hit on the head by a falling koala bear!
They also helped in the research that eradicated polio!
ALSO SCREW THE MALL IN ITS STUPID FACE OKAY
I can think of one way to find out!
Oh well! All's well that ends well, I suppose.
You know what people don't say often enough anymore?
Oh, hey, Dromiceiomimus!  How's - how are things?
UTAHRAPTOR: A GUY WHO IS NOT HELPING RIGHT NOW
Hey, can I bid some ANTI-DOLLARS on your pictures?
LATER, PERFORMING AID AND SANITATION WORK IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA:
Um - geez, I can't do it on demand
Vitamin B12 has a very low potential for toxicity.
I know!  I'll just learn all of them!
Sometimes I do! I wonder what it'd be like.
Okay! How about, "T-Rex: Better Than You Might Expect"?
No! I'd be a tasty taste in the morning!
That's a pretty okay weakness to have, isn't it?
Hello, Dromiceiomimus! I have a friendship crush on you!
Do you have a friendship crush on me, T-Rex?
SOON EVERYONE GETS SICK AND IT'S ALL T-REX'S FAULT:
"Hello? Hello? I'd like to break up with Utahraptor."
Making fun of our fundamental flaws, are we? Classy!
Huh? Oh, you're still here! What were you saying?
Proof: robots are clearly significantly cooler than talking horses!
Do you think everyone wants to be remarkable, T-Rex?
Well, how did you make friends the first time?
I don't think anyone's ever been named "Pine," T-Rex.
What about people who are named for their species?
I REPLACED IT WITH SOME STICKS OF DISCOUNT PEPPERONI
Oh yeah?  Well, not if I do... THIS!
Are there cash awards for poetry, do you know?
You can stop calling  it that anytime, T-REX.
Holy cow! Why would you build something like that?
WAYS TO MAKE SOMEONE FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU
My brain is flooding with new ideas and concepts!
What are you doing? You've already destroyed one universe!
I AM DEFINITELY FLIRTING WITH FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW!!
And - your metaphor includes stomping on women, somehow?
