I will be immortalized by kicking an evil kangaroo one thousand times. Right in the bum!
Here are some things that DEFINITELY won't fit into my mouth. I tried! They won't fit.
Utahraptor, I've got to go practice rocking out now, but can we talk about this tonight?
No, too easy.  Um - "I love you, AND ALSO, how about all these dollars?"
Sexual Congress: Guys, stop sexing me for a minute!! I need to talk to this dinosaur.
Never have I tasted the flesh of SO MANY animals in so short a time period.
Hey, T-Rex! I heard that a friend of yours won the lottery and became ultra rich!
She may be the perfect woman for me, but that doesn't mean she's perfect for everyone!
You're Captain Blam. You're on an alien space ship, armed only with your trusty dehumanizer ray!
I'm just not feeling that motivated, you know? Maybe I'll just get a fast food burger.
OH WAIT THIS IS JUST A PICTURE OF T-REX AND THE EARTH IS LONG SINCE DUST
I know, it's dumb! But I keep thinking about it and I though you should know.
Um... look, you can't tell ANYONE, but I think the Dromiceiomimus has a crush on me.
The Dromiceiomimus? No way! I thought she broke it off with you, like, three years ago!
But what about Robo-horse meets Cyberhorse, Robohorse and the Chamber of Secrets, and King's Quest Horse?
It also happens when folks spend a lot of time wishing they could be Shakespeare's Pal!
Knowing my fetish is technically possible only serves to increase my desire to see it happen!
HEY GUYS HOW ABOUT SEX HUH PRETTY SEXY HEY I'M GONNA DIRECT THE CONVERSATION TOWARDS IT
T-REX DECIDES TO DRINK A BUNCH A FEW NIGHTS LATER.  NOW IT'S THE NEXT MORNING.
My window's at the head of my bed so that's where the words would come from.
The COMMERCIALS! The deals on three-ringed binders! I just want to be a part of that.
Yeah! Because my future-country is in the great while north and therefore everybody lives in igloos.
Michael Chabon: I asked you to proofread a chapter, not to substitute your own retarded story!
Man, you just wait!  Kids will be boarding the train to SCARYTOWNE at my house.
TODAY IS LABOUR DAY (LABOR DAY IN THE UNITED STATES) AND SHE STOOD ME UP AGAIN.
You know, besides being stood up all the time, it wasn't actually that bad a year!
All of this will go in Dromiceiomimus's back yark, which I forgot to ask permission about!
Book Cover Text: HE BROKE UP WITH YOU BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE WITH YOU
Book Cover Text: Probably She's Attracted To Men Who Are Different From You In Some Way
Book Cover Text: THAT LAST BOOK WAS PUT OUT BY DROMICEIOMIMUS, NOT BY ME OR UTAHRAPTOR
Man, I missed out on ROCKET SKATING because I was writing books? That sucks! That -
I gave him my change and whispered "DON'T TELL ANYONE UNTIL I CAN FIGURE US OUT"?
Hey, Utahraptor, if your house was on fire, what one possession would you want to save?
T-Rex's thoughts: Huh! Instead of writing "I rode a horse", I wrote "I wrode a horse"!
You know what would be the worst?  Meeting someone who was ACTUALLY NAMED "Al Coholic".
Maybe he's searching for an answer to that question, Dromiceiomimus... at the bottom of a bottle.
Bill And Ted's Excellent Friggin' Adventure; The Ten Friggin' Commandments; Honey, I Shrunk The Friggin' Kids!
There certainly is a lot of climate that's CHANGING, right? Right?! Can I get a witness?
Man, this party even has a stomping room! I'm totally going to get some punch soon.
[[T-Rex is daydreaming]] Voice from outside the panel: "Hey! Who hit me with this rubber mallet"
I actually ran into him (almost literally) later that afternoon, and we discussed it some more.
He doles out to the world a small amount of an INFINITE SUPPLY of biofeul daily.
T:Rex: Attention, any ghosts that can hear me! I have one thing to say to you:
If you start to scream from just that small bump, he'll know the peritonitis is bad!
GUYS YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO COMPRESS THE FILM NOT MAKE IT INTO A GAY ROMANCE STORY
Oh God. Utahraptor, do you think the NES was the greatest video games system ever? 
After the success of my role of "Tony", the hard-living mechanic, I have won another role!
The technology means the end of all privacy, but also the end of most violent crime...
And hey, if you fall, you'll be whipped backwards at the speed you were travelling at!
You really think people want to ride around on a platforming horse as Richard the Third?
Look, I'm going to prototype it tonight, so by this time tomorrow, we'll see what's what.
Wow, all I have to do is follow your advice, and all my problems are solved!
UTAHRAPTOR. His speaking voice sounds like a text-to-speech synthesizer. That is awesome! That is objectively awesome.
I could say this is one situation in which the free market fails! But I won't!
Ridiculous! You confuse actors and the characters they play as much as any of us. 
T-REX YESTERDAY YOU SAID THAT SPLINTER TAUGHT THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES TO BE NINJA TEAMS
God is all-knowing and all-seeing, right?  So it follows - THROUGH LOGIC - that... that...
He has encyclopaedic knowledge about every RPG, MMORPG, FPS, RTS, TBS and IF game every made!
Did you know that he was named a "messenger of peace" by the United Nations, Utahraptor?
And I'm going to start it by calling everyone "my boy". How's it going, my boy?
And THEN, there's the diseases that are familiar because they're so common, but still messed up!
The Devil is claiming credit for GTA IV. He wants to undermine the entire gaming industry.
I mean, I agree with you, but I can still accept dreams as a narrative device.
When I die, nobody say "he's at peace now", okay?  I'm so serious right now.
I think it's supposed to be taken in a "his suffering is over" sort of way.
Dromiceiomimus, you have stumbled upon my shameful secret!  I- I don't have a family doctor!
Ok, my secret is that I stole the Utahraptor's couch last night! Don't tell him, alright?
Second ONLY to the "I'm so angry my head is now a steamwhistle, toot toot" motif.
Well, to be fair, Benny's a pedophile, and he's on the internet. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, BENNY??
Come on, society doesn't make us all suicidal! It only makes a FEW people suicidal. 
Today is a good day I think for assuming that there's such thing as a soul!
You're saying if there was a guy who could produce utopia, you'd want him in charge.
And luckily for me, these rules clearly stipulate that I can stomp on whatever I want!
I think this is just a matter of figuring out a different sort of Life Points"#8482;!
He goes on to say that he regrets the pun, but it's the most appropriate word?
LATER, T-REX PUBLISHES HIS NEW BOOK! IT'S CALLED "LOLITA 2: THE PREQUEL! NOW LOLITA'S EVEN YOUNGER"
T-Rex (thinking): Hey, it's Utahraptor! Wait - IS that Utahraptor...? Oh my God!  It's... IT'S....
Damn it, T-Rex! All the irony surrounding YOUR friggin' life is now rubbing off on me!
TV: Tonight at 11: what you're eating that could be taking TWENTY YEARS off your life!!
Utahraptor!  When I die I get an award for "Most Opportunities Missed" and nobody claps!!
Shakespeare, add a dinosaur character to Hamlet called "Utahraptor" and have Hamlet tell him off, okay?
METHOD 2: ASK YOUR FRIENDS IF THEY HAVE ANY SEXY FRIENDS THEY COULD INTRODUCE YOU TO!
That's kinda sketch. It can go either way but I think it veers wildly towards Sketchtowne.
Well, has anyone else gotten messages like this?  Maybe the guy really just dislikes you!
Guess who had a bike accident yesterday morning! If you guessed "Shit! T-Rex?" you are correct!!
I'm just concerned that after I'm dead, folks will write books about me filled with sass!
HEY UTAHRAPTOR! DO YOU REMEMBER THREE DAYS AGO, WHEN I TOTALLY BEAT YOU IN AN ARGUMENT?
Unknown: Excuse me, sir: this is a black tie dinner, and you've shown up completely naked.
T-REX IF YOU COULD HAVE A LIFETIME SUPPLY OF ANY ONE THING WHAT WOULD IT BE
NO I MEAN IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING YOU CAN BUY AND PUT IN YOUR ROOM
Sorry, Utahraptor, God's hasslin' me. GOD, I said "friendship" at the start of this stupid conversation!!
That's the sense that lets you know where your body parts are at any given time!
Oh, it's true! But I messed up. I'd really prefer losing nociception: the sense of pain!
FUBS! Oh my goodness. I have to get a dog so I can name him Fubs.
I think every time I remember this I'll swear a li'l and feel bad about myself
The Devil: ARE YOU AWARE WHICH VIDEO GAME CONSOLE IS NOW THE BEST OF ALL TIME
The Devil: PERHAPS YOU COULD CHANGE YOUR ANSWER TO THE VECTREX AND THEN WE COULD PROCEED
"It's the latest in fashions for thunder-lizards," said the thunder-lizard. "It fits my crown perfectly!" 
THAT'S EASY!  DINOSAUR COMICS IS A COMIC ABOUT DINOSAURS!  BUT FELLAS WOULD YOU BELIEVE?
You got closer and closer to it, Zeno-style, but I don't remember you actually TELLING it.
... Which actually sounds like a fun time and is something we should definitely do soon!
Stranger: We like it when you suck on your fingers, T-Rex. "I", "I", "I", "I", "I".
How great would it be to be able to make your voice sound like somebody else's?
T-Rex [[thinking]]: Man, if I don't find a washroom soon others will be disappointed in me
It's especially impressive after I tell you that one in seven Canadians is... A SENIOR CITIZEN!!
Suddenly she threw up on T-Rex, over and over until he was drenched in digestive fluid!
"Dear Professor: How do I know which food that I ate got turned into my eyes?"
I've forgotten pretty much everyone who didn't go on to the same school as I did!
EVERY DAY EACH OF US SAYS THE DUMBEST THING WE ARE GOING TO SAY THAT DAY.
Um, no!  It's science fiction DRAMA.  "Louie Louie" is just a really good song.
I'm not sure I'd want to be with someone who describes their own body as "surprising".
There is no objective order to the world: all values are baseless and reasoning is impotent!
But there's no place on Earth that even comes CLOSE to having such high radiation levels!
Excuse me, do you guys have any movies about "the immigrant experience?"  It's an emergency!
Everyone who loves parking tickets, throw your hands up in the air! Raise the friggin' roof!
Ah. So everyone's stealing my anti-ticket opinions INSTEAD of raising the roof. That's fine, that's cool.
No worries, man!  I've got your back.  Listen.  It'll be a great show.
YOU WOULDN'T THINK IT WAS A BIT OF A LET DOWN AT THE END THEN HUH
I imagine it'd raise some issues of WHAT AWESOME THINGS MY HAND HAS BEEN UP TO!
I imagine it'd raise some issues of WHAT AWESOME THINGS MY HAND HAS BEEN UP TO!
It is this confusion on the part of the listener that is responsible for the humor!
People should compliment me on my smokin' bod more often! I WILL GLADLY DO THE SAME.
Hey. It'll be better for all of us if we just find out who's doing it.
Once upon a time Bonnie Tyler was falling in love, but now she's only falling apart!
I haven't forgotten! I was just, um, going to thank everyone else on the planet first?
I remember this tiny house and car! I liked to stomp on them regularly! Like so!
But you're also special for what you know: information that's recorded nowhere else in the Universe!
Okay, listen, I kinda walked in on you while changing and I saw your naked crotch.
It is entirely analogous to wanting some delicious fried chicken, once every two-thirds of a year.
IT READS "TELL PAST ME THAT SAYING 'BONERS AHOY' IS STILL WAY HILARIOUS IN THE FUTURE"
Dear audio diary: sometimes I worry that the only thing I'm not great at is modesty!
Dromiceiomimus, it's called "penis fencing"! In another reality, I could have a PhD in penis fencing.
If my parents had named me "Lord Britishface the Third", would I be a different person?
Okay, yeah, upon reflection my idea of manliness ALSO involves being way too tough for hygiene.
Oh my goodness, is my absolute favourite weather TRULY the high winds just before a storm?
T-REX HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHAT YOUR LIFE WOULD BE LIKE IF YOU HAD SUPER POWERS
I can at least save this woman from the damaging UV rays of the noonday sun!
That's not a bad point. Okay! I look forward to seeing what you come up with!
Like maybe they have a special version of the Heimlich maneuver that can make you poop!
But not too fast. It's not a race or anything. Just read at your own pace.
It happens in a bunch of stories, Dromiceiomimus, I'm really not sure how you missed them
My friend! Such excellent advice is truly as rare, and as welcomed, as the 3UP moon!!
There are skid marks in front of the skunk! Hey, what's the definition of a gentleman?
Okay. Sinve we've ALL apparently got stupid names, let's just promise never to mention this again.
Utahraptor, remember when you said I'd "never run out of things to learn about Teri Hatcher"?
That's that climactic slow dance from Back to the Future, right? Why do you like it?
Well you tell him that more people playing games means fewer people looking down on gamers!
HE WILL NOT BE BORN FOR 65 MILLION YEARS BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE PAST REMEMBER
It's about a database administrator for a large company who uncovers a secret database by accident!
Okay, so we're hanging out, and I say "T-Rex, I'm gonna go nap in your bed."
You're not worried how suspicious it is for someone to be SO CONCERNED with appearing innocent?
"Here Lies T-Rex: He Never Stopped Saying "Frig" / Even If He Stopped Saying Other Words".
T-Rex" Can we accept that everyone on the internet is PROBABLY a Nazi, and move on??
You know what hasn't happened in space yet? Friggin' murder! Nobody's been murdered in space yet!
I would like it if the chumpified chicks and dudes were true to other selves, please.
Today is the day I cook a meal for all my friends! You're coming, right God?
Wait, I've been here before...it's the Tyrone residence! Mr. Tyrone is arguing with his sons again...
Let's say you can live in any time period in history. Which period do you choose?
Weird, I was thinking a restaurant where you don't have to pay if you're super handsome
But what about if you and I have different ideas about what the perfect dude is?
Narrator [[written as title of the comic]]: "HEY. HEY. YOU HAVE SOMETHING STUCK BETWEEN YOUR TEETH"
Not a fan of your entire life reduced to a single number? Then don't do it!
Utahraptor [off-panel]: Well, that'd be my fault for changing languages in the middle of a sentence.
By following the nutritional regime of the Nutrinomicon, you can be assured of a fine diet!
I even skipped dinner, which is ironic, because I was working on a guide to nutrition!
OH MY GOSH that's the best name EVER. Well, looks my afternoon just got filled up!
A friend of mine!  She's getting married to a woman she met four years ago!
I'm excited! I always look forward to all the food you get to eat during Thanksgiving!
Sorry to interrupt, but I must be on my way! I'm having dinner with the Utahraptor!
Hey, do you know how I could stop the Utahraptor from not being friends with me?
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT IS TRANSMITTED AND WHAT IS RECEIVED an allegorical comic and comic allegory
It's often said that the only way to be immortal is through your words and ideas!
               g
Tonight is a good night I think for having Chick Peas in Coconut Milk for dinner!
You can't honestly expect to get results by walking around shouting for "fine new sexy ladies"!
Your sense of disenchantment comes from a realization that the world is not as you believed!
My only hope is to get them to kiss at the "Enchantment Under the Sea" dance!
Everyone (including me) is an end in himself: not a means to an end for others!
That's not very helpful, is it? You're just adding the same adverb over and over again!
I have received complaints. Apparently I can be difficult to follow, and sometimes people get confused.
There is a silver lining though - we are now completely in love, despite what happened!
Good God, you're right! Let me make this up to you. We'll go to the movies!
Nobody wants to have cooties, despite the fact that they have no effect on anyone whatsoever!
Like all my work, the exclaimation mark belongs in the title. It's that exciting a game!
In effect, WE (and by 'we' I mean 'dinosaurs') have become the all-powerful Gods of old!
Shouldn't you be having these thoughts in your private lair, rather than out in the open?
All I have to do is sit around all day and think, then I become enlightened!
Something that says, "This is an awesome dude!" but also says "You should sign the guestbook!"
So don't get all holier-than-thou on me!  Maybe I just like the taste of nicotine!
Conversely, this house provides no value to me, and my relation with it is understandably strained!
Pterodactyl 1: I made us a lasagna for dinner- we just have to heat it up.
Of course I'm hungry! I could eat my weight in carrots -- er -- raw meat.
From now on I will be pensive, considerate. I will be a reflective and thoughtful T-Rex!
There's only four panels, no little people, no dromiceiomimus, and we look all different! Everything's changed!
I usually star in the first panel, then you, my sidekick, come only three panels later...
Sure it is!  If you're hung up about consciousness, consider it to be emergent behavior!
I'm not going to enjoy it with you when you stole all my cookies, you scallywag!
To the last, I will grapple with thee!  From hell's heart, I stab at thee!
I've always seen you more as representing the essential struggle between man and his darker half.
I mean, a chemical that makes me seem irresistible to women? What is that, reverse alcohol?
To clean up the beer; yeah, I get it. That's not a very good joke, T-rex!
There!  It's done!  Now you can stop talking about your damn bicuriosity: it's satisfied!
I have determined something exciting! Brace yourselves, for what I have discovered is nothing less than...
Stop eating my food, damn it! You have the ability to go find your own nourishment!
Or should I say, it will have been seeming like a good idea at the time?
Since she's an Indian dinosaur, she cant help but have anything she eats become Indian food!
You didn't! Look, it's my movie, and I'm going to put the Dromiceiomimus in the lead.
I'm the one who's been working against you in the faculty! Please accept my apologies, T-Rex!
Lovely stomp, wonderful stomp! Little house, how would you like a moderate dose of stompage today?
But rather than point out the failings of others, I will first endeavour to improve myself!
I don't have a goatee! That Utahraptor has moved to... Good God! He's in my universe!
Ha ha!  You know, some people say pi r squared, but I know they're round!
"Explore your feelings"?  Shuck that jive, man!  Feelings are for sissies and the elderly!
This will be my first heterosexual wedding. I'm excited! I got a nice card and everything!
OKAY WELL IF YOU WORE PANTS IT WOULD WORK REALLY WELL ON ALL SORTS OF THINGS
Aww, why'd you do that?  I was imagining I was the last man on Earth!
Have you ever imagined what it would be like if you WERE a movie star, T-Rex?
What if there was someone exactly like you in every way, only HE didn't get sunburns?
Hm... maybe social relationships would be much easier if everyone said exactly what they were thinking!
OH MY GOSH! Is this my role in life? Am I to be forever DEFINING FATALISM?
T-Rex, you have to make your readers feel scared! You just can't tell them they're scared.
Hey, T-Rex, I've a favor to ask! Can you tell me when seven minutes have passed?
And then, in the last sentence, a filing cabinet says "You're fired, and I can talk!"
That bizarre thing with the Utahraptor that I don't want to talk about: all a dream!
Hello! I had been in a mirror universe, where we all had goatees and were evil!
They are what allow us to get along with others, and are the foundation of society!
Care to put our emotional stability on the line in exchange for a chance at happiness?
No I'm not! It's just that dreams always sound really symbolic when they're described, that's all!
It was a DREAM I had. Just cause I dreamed it doesn't mean I believe it!
Ho ho!  Did you hear that, Dromiceiomimus?  I had a snooze... and didn't lose!
Because normally people say "You snooze, you lose", but in my case I didn't lose anything!
Perhaps!  There are many twists and turns and revelations in my exciting non-canon tale, Dromiceiomimus!
You scored 0 points out of a possible 158. Thank you for playing Sierra's DINO QUEST!
Haven't we gone over this before? Declaring yourself to be angry doesn't excuse personal responsibility, T-Rex!
Does "Betty put butter on the bread" mean the same thing as "Betty buttered the bread"?
Wow! These small changes in semantics (he meaning of a word or phrase) are quite interesting!
I'm a  man, and I don't know what Stereotypical Male Fantasy Number 2 is either!
Time to fix all my relationship issues with my girlfriend, Kayleigh, by going back in time...
Oh man.  What an embarrassing slip of the tongue!  I have to go now!
That's okay! Come on: living forever? I could do anything! I could do EVERYTHING - twice!
But why? Usually people brag about awesome things, not lame-o things like going to bed early.
For we can always see and feel much that the people in old photos and newsreels
Or if he worked as a chipmunk, he'd say "I'm going to ho-ho-hoard all these nuts!"
But where's the magic? Where's the love and care that is shown in a well-wrapped present?
BUT THAT MAKES THINGS WORSE THAN EVER! EVERYBODY IS GOING TO BECOME A BABY OR SOMETHING!
BUT THAT MAKES THINGS WORSE THAN EVER! EVERYBODY IS GOING TO BECOME A BABY OR SOMETHING!

Care to put our emotional stability on the line in exchange for a chance at happiness?
And all the ladies proclaim that I'm quite adequate for a man of my racial denomination!
He may be unaware of certain pertinent pieces of information, and he may not be urbane...
Dude, keep your voice down! What's the big deal? I could hear you a kilometer off!
MY FRIEND, IT'S CLEAR THAT SHOUTING IS THE BEST WAY TO HAVE INNER DIALOGUES. I AGREE
These events set in motion other events which finally led to the person I am today!
The Utahraptor's brother is having children - it seems the time of parenthood is upon us!
But did YOU know that some motorcycle enthusiasts refer to long motorcycle rides as "numb bumming"?
So the good news is that the raccoons and cephalopods aren't hanging around my house anymore!
Hey, do you think these recent events in your life could be an allegory for racism?
Or MAYBE he's making the whole thing up! That would explain why I don't remember it.
Would it not be pretty neat to average out your emotional states across your entire life?
No way Dromiceiomimus! I bet that I would be on average at least KIND of happy.
That would be pretty awful, knowing that on the whole, your life is one of sadness!
Dromiceiomimus, you know how doctors will hit your knee with a hammer to test your reflexes?
Actually, my friend, I would disagree! I think there are more productive uses of your time.
The "Straw Man" fallacy isn't so much a fallacy as it is a way of life!
Whatever, Dromiceiomimus!  You're fine.  But look at MY thigh: it's somewhat larger than before
Oh, are we gonna talk about cultural relativism?  Cause I can talk about cultural relativism!
Man, glasses are gonna cramp my style. I'm not a glasses dude! I'm a NON-GLASSES dude!
I know one thing that puts us (living people made out of meat) above machine intelligences.
Yeah, it's kissing and telling years later, which, for serious, will not lead to good things.
But what if I have only good things to say about them, hmm? What about THAT?
So - dating ex-girlfriends? I've heard this can be a bad idea, but I don't know...
Unlike SOME people, I like it when I have a dumb song stuck in my head!
WAYS TO WIN OR AT LEAST END ARGUMENTS IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT PEOPLE RESPECTING YOU
I don't think it's called racism if it's against a heterogenous group like taxi drivers, T-Rex.
Aw no, not this again. Come on T-Rex, passing off lyrics as conversations ONLY AMUSES YOURSELF.
Well MAYBE he wrote in his diary that he did agree, and I've read his diary!
A list of phrases you should never say because nothing good will ever come of them!
I suppose I'd talk to both of the people to see what they'd have me do.
Has anyone ever heard of a book series called, oh I don't know...  "HARRY POTTER"?!
DUDE BY MY COUNT YOU'VE CHASED AFTER LIKE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE BIRDS WHILE NAKED
Dromiceiomimus, I'm so manly that I crack open walnuts for old ladies with my pectoral muscles!
Oh yeah?  Well I'M so manly that I do that too, WHILE IMPREGNATING MY GIRLFRIEND.
I'm not hotted out by women who continue to wear high heels while getting increasingly naked.
I have a Theory about conventional western civilization being infatuated with a cartoonish idea of femininity.
Well take me off the shelf and put me in a plastic bag, because I'm sold!
That was muchas delicious but did little to resolve the disparate issues raised by today's events!
How do they come up with all my ideas before I even articulate them?  
That's because, some days, I take an envelope out of hte box and I PUSH IT.
I just got off a bus featuring the World's Cryiest Baby. Oh man, what a relief!
I TOO WILL LEAVE FOR I MERELY WISH TO PLAY CLASSIC NES GAMES FOR FREE T-REX
It's actually been on my to-do list for a while now, if you can believe that.
Yeah, but BEFORE that, it could have been anywhere! What if it was a poo bug?
I've decided to write a story about my own team of superheroes. That's right! They're called...
Well, I'm perfectly content.  Time to mix things up by staying awake for 41 hours!
You know how vanilla extract smells really good, but tastes really gross when you drink it?
THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX THINKS EVERYONE SHOULD GO TO CLASS, BUT NOBODY IS GOING TO CLASS:
There's no time for that now! The ship is sinking and there are not enough lifeboats!
You'll miss out on seeing all the costumes of the kids who come to your house!
I have discovered a new philosophy for life that appeals to my own sense of self-worth!
So if I was paralyzed from the chest down would I not feel my stress anymore?
So did I just find a cure for the stress of the modern world or what?
I don't know! I can't look up mice on the internet because my internet is down!
IN WHICH ONE PERSON IS THE GAME MASTER AND TELLS EVERYONE ELSE WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM
Can we avoid this conversation if I say my favourite food is sweet and sour chicken?
And we never will! What's to be gained from arguing fine semantic points of justifying MURDER?
I will call my house, "The House Where It's Very Hard To Get Any Work Done".
If you ever need some help getting groceries, Morris, I bet we could help you out!
Ahhh! Oh wow, that's a great one. Man! Can you imagine feeling your own pulse stop?
Well, Henrietta never found out. She was never even told that the cells were being cultivated!
Hey, if you learn to play the piano, does that mean you'll stop stomping on things?
In fact, the only fault I can find in robots is with their real life counterparts!
DURING THE NIGHT EVERYONE IN THE WORLD BUT T-REX IS REPLACED BY A SINISTER ROBOT CLONE:
How excellent are we talking about?  I bet they were named "Cheeseball" and "Chuggy G".
Those are terrible names!  Those are names you give to cats that you don't like.
Right! Like how I'm in a minority because I sometimese like to sleep in on weekends.
Oh right, Utahraptor's having trouble with this dude he's been seeing! I forgive his critical outburst.
It would be a great way to be remembered every time someone puts out a fire!
And then we all decide to pitch in and take over the ice cream cone factory?
My friend, I will handle that situation by simply "ignoring my principles" and "reversing my position".
MAN! EVERYONE is making it really hard for me to solve the eternal problem of unhappiness!
Well - sure! Okay! Okay, yeah, let's just - you know, set out.  For adventure.
How had we gone from love to masturbation so quickly? Had this question been asked before?
Yep!  It's nice to see you writing a nice wholesome children's book for a change.
Aww, we wouldn't do that, T-Rex!  We would bury you with all the cool kids.
It seems to me we'd all be better off if utahraptor had never told you anything.
NEGATIVE IT IS MORE ACCURATELY WHEN ONE BESTS A VIDEO GAME IN THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE TIME
T-REX PLEASE INFORM YOUR COMPANION THAT DABBLING IN MACHINE-ASSISTED RUNS IS THE ULTIMATE
