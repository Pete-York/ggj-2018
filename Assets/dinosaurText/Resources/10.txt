Off-panel: Aw FRIG, now the penguin has eaten the tiger!
ALMOST. It actually gives me the strength of twenty girlfriends!
This - you know this is a terrible idea, right?
T-Rex and Utahraptor: We've got to go write some material!

Alright, but you have to promise not to tell anyone!
Sure! "We Illustrate Kinks Involving Phallocentric Europhia During Intercourse. Awesome."
It's the Secret Mission of Wikipedia! Don't tell anyone, okay?
And as it turns out... it is not that awesome?
Hilarious!! Plus, it offers some resistance to machine gun fire.
Benny, look, you gotta find a better name for that.
These are symptoms! We should be working on the causes!
Anyway, this is a skill I've developed in real life!
Hey, you know what's weak? Saying "question mark" really fast.

I'm SO GLAD we named it Frigday instead of "Friday"!
So I flipped him off. It was BICYCLE ROAD RAGE!

Maybe they'd rather have their pride than a few dollars!
Whatever!  I can come up with painting names later!
I'M GONNA STOP TALKING NOW AND RE-EVALUATE SOME DECISIONS OKAY
Ladies! Gentlemen! Everybody stop what you're doing for a sec.

I feel odd.. as if my amnesia is wearing off!
Seriously, it makes me feel like doing whatever you say!
"I SAW YOUR NAKED CROTCH BUT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT"
I suppose you're proposing we somehow make "work" more entertaining?
No no, I meant, "This is hilarious because he's vegan?"
And it's called "penis fencing". Utahraptor, I can't get enough.
Violence can also be an effective way of saying "no"!
Was this entire conversation an excuse for that crappy pun?
Anyway I'm off, I need to go drop a barf
Okay! Honestly not really sure what I just said there!
I agree such a name might colour a child's life!
...to ignore my provocation and leave me alone, that is!
Dromiceiomimus, please. Of course I know what a calorie is!
... It sounds weird when I say it out loud.
As the saying goes, "three women are trice as nice"!
I really don't see this "pregnancies induced equals manliness" connection!
Also someone who doesn't heckle their friends when he disagrees.

Dinosaur Present Day, Featuring T-Rex, has been a complete success!

It's a machine to create happiness.  A happy machine!
And how do you plan to accomplish this miraculous transformation?
Easy! I simply replace every instance of "baby" with "matey"!

It's old slang!  It means something was really good!
Hah hah!  Imagine if we were at a vineyard?
I guess I just got swept up in the enthusiasm.
Awesome! Okay, what was it you wanted to talk about?

Do you not recall how I remarked on my disappointment?
Credit card fraud is a growing problem in today's society!
I wonder, are there any universes parallel to our own?
I object to the word "Chicks"! Change it to "women".
Thank you! I did only what came naturally to me.
From now on, I'll be sticking to things that WORK!

Or maybe he's travelled to the Universe of the Lesbains!
Dromiceiomimus, would you agree that life is a neoclassical pastiche?
Oh yeah? Let's put it to the public, shall we?
Would you say you and your girlfriends find that... attractive?
Hey T-Rex, what's your favourite cross-cutting technique of all time?

You just defined fatalism... despite your best efforts not to!

You know what? I bet it wasn't even very crazy!
But then, where would I be getting my energy from?
Hey Dromiceiomimus, what time are you going to bed tonight?
Word has it you're bragging about going to bed early?
and gone.   -Robert Rosenstone, "Visions of the Past"
Aha! You just used the wrong "its" there, my friend!
Wait - I take it this happened to you recently?
Time to wrap up some presents for all my friends...
Like wrapping them in the plastic bags they came in!
T-Rex, this is no time to begin stomping on houses!
What? I already stomped on it like 5 seconds ag-
T-Rex! I have a desperate plan to save us all!

"We can sexy" is totally going to be my epitaph!
I challenge myself to watch fifty-two movies in fifty-two days!
Have we - finally - become "too cool for school"?
Well, I'D invite him over for dinner! We'd have chops!
HEY I CAN PERSONIFY THEM FOR REAL IF YOU WANT
The water heater's leaking and my showers are all cold!
Come one, come all to the Circus of the Improbable!
Yes indeed, it is a nice day, to be sure!
Do you ever wonder what the pillow fights are like?
That's the best example you can come up with? Scrabble?
The first of your "amusing observations" seems almost reverse sexist!
To summarize: the THRUST of what I'm saying is -
Spring is my favourite season, Dromiceiomimus. Do you know why?
It is my favourite season because it is so pretty!
How quickly we find ourselves in the positions of adults!
Dromiceiomimus, do you think you might have children some day?
This is a stupid theory! It doesn't get you anything!
I bet you don't know much about good jokes anyway!
Woman: C'mon T-Rex! We got 2 straws for a reason!
Heh. I never noticed before, but they are kinda cute.
But look: I'm crushing a house! It is very frightening!
You're ignoring some of the immediate consequences of your actions.
Wow - you're really afraid of those cute little guys!
These wouldn't happen to be URBAN LEGENDS, would they, T-Rex?
"Boo hoo hoo! Let's have a lengthy discussion about FEELINGS."
No way dudes! Nothing you can say will scare me!
Raccoons/Cephalopods: COME BLEED WITH US. COME BLEED WITH US, T-REX.
Oh man, I'm still a little tired from last night!
You're going to have to define that for me, T-Rex!
But I ask: assuming it exists, what is its deal?
I concede that, sometimes, it's nice to be polite! However!
Oh man, did I get you? Did I get you?
Hah! Hey how did you know I use the internet?
The world revolves around me The world revolves around me
BY THE WAY THAT IS A PRETTY CATCHY TUNE T-REX
I forgot to feed the dog! I'll do it tomorrow.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ADVENTURE GAMES AS A GENRE
I'm sorry, I - I think I'm busy that night!
I think that marriage is a very personal thing, T-rex!
The eye doctor had told me I might need glasses!
I don't know - maybe they'll look fetching on you!
YOU FORGOT TO GIVE ME THE ANSWER TO MY PROBLEM!
A MASTERY OF TORSIONAL TWISTING IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE VICTORY
I can't believe it! I've played a game you haven't?!
You shoot little ducks on the TV with your gun!
The house?  Why would a house be bothering me?
I'm not sure what you're trying to argue here, T-Rex!
Many people wish to know how live a meaningful life!
That's the most facile anger management technique I've ever heard!
I could probably turn all-you-can-eat ribs into a freakin' aria!
More casual, eh?  More like more casual KISSING, probably!
Why all this talk about self-doubt, T-Rex? Are YOU self-doubting?
No, but I don't have any doubt in myself, see?
Aww, look at the big baby! Baby wants his bottle!
He does not!  Buffy was a really well-written show!
THE ETYMOLOGY OF THE WORD "WOMAN" - IN COMIC FORM!
So "werewolf" is actually a more sexist word than "woman"!
In other news, I'm now also racist against that phrase!
T-REX IN: THERE'S A LOT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT STUFF
T-REX IN: THERE'S A LOT I DO KNOW ABOUT ME
My body has failed me for the first time ever!
Also, I'm not sure how I feel about competitive eating.
I agree, T-Rex; I think you are to blame here.
Why visit Australia, when it's closer to visit outer space?
Female teachers used to be called "teacheresses"? That's so bizarre!
Dude! You're not allowed to lie to your own diary!
I'm not upset with you!  I'm just tired today.
Time to talk more about my made-up country of Canada!
(We believe materials are deoxygenated and become oxygenated when burning!)
There sure is a lot I don't know about ...
"I've always seen you as the mother I never had."
It's a difficult situation for everyone involved to be in!
But what if they want you to do conflicting things?
Have you done anything to get rid of it? 
Hey T-Rex, want to go see a movie with me?
I find that most movies need way more explosions, though.
Looks like you blew your chances with us, my friend!
Did that fix time? I don't think that fixed time!
Whoah, I think you're putting to much into this, T-Rex!
I also hope I was the one who ended it.
You're going to be a crotchety old man, my friend!
AND so fun! AND a recipe for a one-man party!
Okay, people have had my awesome idea before.  BUT!
I think this idea has been put forward before, T-Rex!
Really, you did that? That's very unkind! Were they alright?
Hah hah!  Come'ere you, I was just fooling around!
T-Rex {{thought bubble}}: {{censored}} {{censored}} {{censored}} {{censored}} {{censored}} mother {{censored}}!!
Now, to convince my friends that I'm not coo-coo KRAZY!
The question the Devil just asked me about "orphaned games!"
Ew, T-Rex! You don't know where that bug has been!
Time to make some Life Decisions, set some Life Goals!
And you're hoping to avoid this by having Life Goals?
But maybe they didn't move, T-Rex! Maybe they just DISAPPEARED!
(One more thing checked off on my lifetime 'To-Do' list!)
MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE THERE'S NO WORD FOR LOVE:
Wait - are you really abandoning the ethic of reciprocity?
Hey, can you do "I wish I was never born"?
ARGH!  I am getting angry just thinking about it!
I think you'd still be able to see things, actually!
What the heck is wrong with everyone in this universe?
I just don't understand why nobody is going to class.
No thank you, T-Rex! I don't buy my compliments. 
And ladies, I am all about putting theories into practice!
Utahraptor (off-panel): Really?  You think the word 'tenet' is-
And yeah, functions like this are a basis of cryptography!
I'm serious!  This is a big concern for me!
Hahahah! You get knocked down, but you get up again!
Therefore, yes, it is possible to have too many friends!
I don't have too many friends! I was speaking hypothetically!
THE DAY DROMICEIOMIMUS INVITED PEOPLE TO A PARTY TOO EARLY
I - I guess I don't have any other plans!
I know! I'm freaking out over here. This is me:
HUH??? CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN THE CONFLUX OF THESE TWO EVENTS?
Is this a new kind of come-on for you, T-Rex?
I think I need to start thinking "outside the box"
I must stomp unceasingly or we are all surely doomed!
It seems that all your stages of fashion involve stomping.
T-REX CAN YOU RATE YOUR FAMILIARITY WITH CLASSIC PEN-AND-PAPER RPGS
T-REX SOMEHOW SETS UP JUST SUCH A CHARITY BY ACCIDENT:
But then you'd always hit your head on the ceiling!
I'm Utahraptor, by the way.  Pleased to meet you!
Unfortunately, all the good ones are taken. Sucks to THAT!
HEY T-REX YOU SHOULD PROBABLY DO SOME CHRISTMAS SHOPPING SOON
Does he like Asian cultures too, or just Asian women?
I will say it again in French, friends and neighbors!
I would seriously marry robots if it were even possible.
It's okay!  We'll be your friends even without presents.
Because if so, put me down for one million anti-dollars!
Do anti-dollars really mutually annihilate when combined with regular dollars?
Man! EVERYONE has better reasons for being here than me!
I think there's posters in the library warning about that.
Vitamin B12, also called cobalamin, is important to good health.
What is the health risk of too much vitamin B12?
Actually, I'd say most people like to do that, T-Rex.
Have all my years of sleepy shame been for naught?
That probably sounds more sexually permissive than you intended, T-Rex.
Hah! No, I'm actually looking for slogans that are POSITIVE.
FUN FACT: THAT'S NOT HOW SMELL ASSOCIATION WORKS AT ALL!
It's totally true, even if all the messages arrive unmolested!
GREETINGS T-REX HAVE YOU EXPERIENCED PLAYING A RAIL SHOOTER GAME
For instance: these smart machines could make even smarter machines!
So why does a super intelligent AI make predictions impossible?
You do know the two genres are closely related, right?
Come on, God! Would you rather battle Klingons on trolls?
Way to be happy #1: amnesia!  Forget your problems!
THAT only works if you're euphoric whenever expectations are met.
BUT THEN, INSPIRATION!  A PERFECT SOLUTION FOR ENDLESS JOY!
You can ALSO be remarkable by, holy shit, memorably cussin'!
But instead of androids you'd have prospectors, and fake librarians.
Hah! I might accuse you of that just for fun.
Dromiceiomimus, want to go on a wacky adventure with me?
T-Rex, I'm not sure if this is fair to bisexuals.
With your knowledge, you can never again stomp the humans!
There are friendships that go beyond this shared benefit, T-Rex!
COMICS IN WHICH A GOD SUDDENLY FEELS A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE
Will no-one make my video game dream a fevered reality?
I seriously just can't stop blabbing about Dromiceiomimus's secret identity!
[[Scene description]] Today, origin of the Dinosaur Comics, part }I{
Ahhh, my old dinosaur bones yearn for a simpler time.
Truly ignorance is bliss. Ignorance and stomping humans, that is.
Yes, all I have to do is be reincarnated. Indefinitely!
Dromiceiomimus! I've come up with a new saddest thing ever!
They do if they want to use the washrooms, dammit.
Also: that I have played loose and fast with language.
Man, you must really like sleeping with the window open,T-Rex!
Man, that was ME you slapped in the face, T-Rex!
Primitivism has this strange semi-positive racism attached to it too.
MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE EVERYONE IS AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN:
Everyone is fighting everyone in and ENDLESS BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL!
I think that you're being too strict about this, T-Rex!
I actually don't think I ever want to find out!
Proof in the form of lyrics from POPULAR MUSIC, baby!
"You look around and see that the answer is yes!"
No!!  I promise to never punch out a turkey.
You're saying you wish more literature was like fairy tales?
I think the strongest feeling is that of shame, T-Rex!
But, are you not forgetting the memorable emotion of hunger?
Good God! What are you cephalopods doing in my bedroom??
Dude! It's not like you can't just make your own!
The hell? What was I saying about us not existing?
Man!  What is the DEAL with triflin' friends indeed?
Then she takes the narrator's money when he's in need!
Stomping a few buildings and women should get his attention...
That was awfull. Your "music" is against gods divine plan.
Has this strapping young dinosaur perhaps become a little... COMPLACENT?
Edgar Allan Poe: I'm just chillin' on your couch, T-Rex!
That's Inaccessibly Crazy, which is its own beast all together!

So people can bet in-game money to win real-life money?
So people can bet in-game money to win real-life money?
Are you a person who uses phrases at incorrect times?
I hope that will not be the case today, with...
So Kant's Categorical Imperative is more of a meta-directive, right?
are we to use these words in place of "bitches"?
Seriously? Does that mean I get into heaven FOR FREE?
Captain Suggestible: I forgive you! I forgive you so hard!!
Maybe!  Mostly I see elements of myself.  
Hello world!  I have the following announcements to make!
DUDE THAT'S LIKE THE EXAC
