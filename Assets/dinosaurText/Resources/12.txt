Maybe it's whoistopless@ohheyeveryoneitsme.com, dowepartyhard@yesthatishowweparty.net, OR imtiredofpartying@guessimelderlynow.co.uk.  Any of those are good.
Practicing does not make you get bigger, only getting older does that.
Future T-Rex: Utahraptor! I'm gonna kiss you so much in ten minutes!
But before you do that, T-Rex, you should consider your investment goals!
Oh, Mr. Tusks! how do you always know just what to say?
Tiny Towne Island?  I thought he just came from Tiny Towne.
Utahraptor, you're right!  I need to apologize to him right away.
Sensitive dependence on initial conditions! It's chaos theory applied to personalities, right?

The deal is that they're building a family and propagating the species!

Passer By 3 (small text): but i've already been to the fair

Your honour, you seem very competent! I like that in a woman.
I would have thought you'd choose the bullet hole / water one!

Later, I had sex! Later still, I went back to the dentist.
But WHAT IF he recognized that and let those people be free?
You're asking, "How much of someone's personality is determined by their body?"
Why, I think I'll play by my own rules from now on!
Yes! Remember? "...values are baseless and nothing can be known or communicated"?
Look, are any sayings about how it's WORSE than living for money?
Oh my God! It's him! I'm sure of it. It's totally him!
T-REX HAS WRITTEN A STORY ABOUT A DOG THAT GETS SUPER POWERS!
The only downside is that the Dromiceiomimus won't be able to come.
T-Rex!! Did you draw yourself in my kitchen giving a thumbs up?
Hey- If that's the case, maybe Dromiceiomimus got an illustration of me?
T-Rex, remember yesterday?  You were totally right!  Fully and completely.
YEARS LATER, UTAHRAPTOR ONCE AGAIN REFERS TO HIS LIPS AS "LITTLE PILLOWS":

Well, frig, this has been a complete waste of a Monday morning!
You're sure it's not autobiographical?  No problems with the tax man?
ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN YOU HAVE NO TROUBLES WITH THE TAX MAN
HEY! TOO BAD YOU'VE GOT NO OTHER GODS TO COMPLAIN TO, HUH??
Attention, everyone!! That was pretty much all I had to say, actually

You don't need God to dump someone!! Oh my God, Utahraptor. Yes!
I keep saying that but it keeps happening!  It's total crap!!
The names of the comedians are like the title of that song?
T-Rex, what I am about to say, I say with all honesty.
GUESS TWO THIRDS OF THE AVERAGE GUESS TWO THIRDS OF THE AVERAGE!!
THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT WHEN I SAY "BOO" PEOPLE GET TOTALLY SPOOKED
You have kicked their ass at chess so HARD that they DIED.
But that's because there's not much we actually know about Shakespeare's life.
T-REX LISTEN THIS IS WHY I DON'T THINK ABOUT RELIGION THAT HARD
Abandoned puppies, and little birds with a wing in a cast. Aww!
And the balloon wasn't filled with helium! It was filled with water.
And another one that says "We all get to live forever now!"
[[Thinking]] No-one must know I bet Utahraptor peed on the wall though

And I present proof!  Proof by explaining what I just said!
UM OBVIOUSLY I MEANT A BETTER DEGREE FROM A MORE RESPECTABLE SCHOOL.
Fahrenheit DOES ensure there's no negative numbers when dealing with commonly-encountered temperatures.
I think all this underscores how arbitrary these systems of measurement are!
T-REX YOUR FANTASY LIFE IS FILLED WITH CONFLICT AND ALSO DISTURBING IMAGERY
But you're not saying anything beyond "Given certain assumptions, religion sounds okay"!

Two! Folks who dismiss thousands of people out-of-hand based on one quality.
Folks I Will ALWAYS Be Friends With: a list by me, T-Rex!
WELL IT'S ONLY A SMALL CHANGE FROM THE WAY THINGS ARE NOW
But do you actually obtain anything by talking in such a way?
Secondly, I, um, don't like it when my theories are proven wrong
Um, that's not actually universal, T-Rex! "Universal" means EVERYTHING, not just Earth!
Why do so many people take an instant dislike to PROFESSION MEMBERS?
...as every human being who has a name that starts with "H"!!
What? I never said "Teri Hatcher"!  I meant knowledge in general.
Or I could just take a vow of silence until I die!
And what if "Johnny B. Goode" was played as the next song?
If they made "Horse Game 64", I would TOTALLY buy that game!
I really haven't thought about industry ramifications of casual gaming that much!
Man, it'd be easier for me if others could hear you too!
I know that folks got opinions about rape! I'm one of 'em!
Okay, time to get myself into some of them books of quotations!
I will, one day, have the best breakfast of my entire life.
MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE INSTEAD OF SAYING "BREAKFAST", T-REX SAID "GIRLFRIEND":
Honestly I don't know what you feel that brings to the conversation.
And it totally doesn't count to say I already have an accent!
Oh, for sure, but all my accents sound like bad Irish fakes!
I GOTTA SAY THAT IS A PRETTY GOOD GIST OF WHAT HAPPENED.
And if you go back 1500 years or so, say, fifty-five generations?
T-Rex, you only ever call me nicknames when you owe me money.
I can already see the headline: "The First Dude Murdered In Space!"
[[In a Scroll]]: "Doctors never talk about inflammation of the arse ropes"
Hah! This is what you get for thinking out loud, my friend!
Hah! This is what you get for thinking out loud, my friend!
Or maybe you're just being narrow in your definition of science fiction!
My friend, I believe you are unfortunately TOTES WRONG on this one!
That's right, I said it! Some people's true selves are total chumps!
It's just - I don't really know what it sounds like yet
T-Rex, from within a thought cloud: Utahraptor, I bought you some shoes!
Utahraptor, from within a thought cloud: Really?  Wow!  What size?
Nope! He said "DUDE FILL IN FOR A TEN YEAR OLD GIRL"
Nope! He said "DUDE FILL IN FOR A TEN YEAR OLD GIRL"
Yes! But we recognize that one dies so that others may live.
It turns out that we never get good at splitting the bill!

In fact, I'm pretty sure I'm ALREADY an amazing dentist, you guys!
Mylings are Scandinavian ghosts! They're way better than regular ghosts, you guys!
Nobody builds for TWO infinite buses showing up right after the other!
Okay!  Today is the day for some tips on being romantic!
But lots of the alternative names can be considered obscene, can't they?
FRIG that'd be awesome. I love fixing stuff I didn't even break!!
Did you hear that friggin' updates are available to be installed, T-Rex?
It's because parents totally assume their babies are talking about them! 
It's kinda awesome that these words are built to flatter new parents.
The Devil: WITH NEW GRAPHICS DELIVERING ASTOUNDING NEW VISTAS NEVER BEFORE SEEN
Aw man, things were going so well with the Devil for once!
Why bother remaking a game if you're just going to change it?
The Devil: T-REX I WOULD REQUEST AN INTRODUCTION TO YOUR FRIEND UTAHRAPTOR
No friend of MINE would commit a cuss like that to writing!
And there's Mrs. Tyrone, wandering aimlessly.  I could stomp her too...
Because the Tyrones will be more miserable if you let them live.
I'm not insulting anyone, I'm just not a fan of live autobio.
Morris: oh i'm fine, t-rex, it's very nice of you to ask
Yeah, you won't have to deal with that until you're way older!
It's DEFINITELY time for me to fix the great works of fiction!
Except that doesn't include oceans and stuff - things you can't buy!
But maybe we don't have the money to buy an ambulance anyway!
I'm continuing to stomp things until someone yells, "look out! A MONSTER!"
They're still working on cutting that page in half, God bless 'em.
You guys! I just wrote the best will. It's the best will!
You CAN force your heirs to punch a bear in your will!
Um, "love" is there and it's not actually about love at all?
What's the deal with people who quote other people all the time?
I wonder what life would be like if I were a woman!
I may have unintentionally lied or alienated every one of my friends!
My old push-over self is extinct - now I'm a self-motivated dynamo!
You know what? You should be the one doing the talking here!
Ooh!  Ooh!  Can I be your guest for the wedding?
Being at my first wedding is exciting, but also makes me nervous!

Today I am hungry! Perhaps I could satisfy this hunger by eating...
What do you get a fully grown Tyrannosaurus Rex for his birthday?
You have to admit you've got through a lot of houses lately!
Wow, that's exciting!  I wonder who'll be at the party tonight?
Utahraptor (as T-Rex): Trick or treat, or I'll stop on your house!
There's a text passed down for hundreds of generations, translated, re-written, re-edited.
Have you tried reading multiple sources and, then synthesizing your own viewpoint?
You know "more than one partner" ... "more than one book" ...
Indeed I am! The turmeric gives the dish its distinctive yellow colour.
I will be pleased to seduce you after introductions have been made!
Alright, continue shouting! I wouldn't want to support a sexual DOUBLE STANDARD.
Yes, I will freely enjoy stomping more now that he is gone!
I'd be careful with that, T-Rex... nostalgia can be a powerful drug!
I wonder, what's the best thing that could happen to me today?
First things's first! We have to travel back in time to 1955!
But the Delorean needs power for the flux capacitor: 1.21 jigawatts worth!
Why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here?
I will, assuming lightning strikes the clock tower at exactly 10:04 p.m.!
Luckily, as a warm-blooded being, this cold weather means little to me!
Yes, some would argue that you are in fact a cold-blooded being!
You know, I've never really been comfortable with being a vegetarian Dromiceiomimus.
I need to think of awesome presents to get all my friends!
I have a hunch you might find some surprises there, is all!
Dromiecieomimus: Well thank YOU for the chocolates, T-Rex! They were very nice.
This holiday of yours seems to have spread a lot of goodwill!
Wouldn't it be great if EVERY day could be Dinosaur Present Day?
Speaking of which: thanks for the portrait! It's a very good likeness.
Dromiceiomimus, do you know what the longest word in the dictionary is?
Dromiceiomimus, do you know what the longest word in the dictionary is?
WHY DO WE DRIVE ON A PARKWAY AND PARK ON A DRIVEWAY?
IS IT TRUE THAT CANNIBALS DON'T EAT CLOWNS BECAUSE THEY TASTE FUNNY?
Come, then. What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.
I believe today I will go down to the beach and swim!
Is it still alright to hold a door open for a lady?
Damn right! That's because we're all part of a cybernetic collective consciousness.
We can't trust our senses! The entire world could be an illusion!
But of course I don't try to read too much into that...
I had this dream where I was playing basketball with Bill Cosby.
AS THE UTAHRAPTOR GIVES HIS SUGGESTION, THE T-REX'S FACE FILLS WITH EXCITEMENT...
I can't believe the Utahraptor's a smoker!  I can't believe it!
YOU smoke TOO?!  I could stomp a house, I'm so shocked!
Huh?  I don't hear anything.  Maybe you're going CRAZY, T-Rex!
This is a very dull panel. What is on the next panel?
I'm fine, fine! But it sounds like maybe you're a little late!
I'm going to write my autobiography! But rather than writing it myself,
I'm going to write my autobiography! But rather than writing it myself,
Say, what do you think about stomping on some houses and stuff?
...which would actually be okay because, as a carnivore, I... eat... rabbits.
There's a real gay looking Josie and the Pussycats type background too!
Driving a car! Uncanny, yes? Don't worry, there is no invisible car!
That's nothing! You wanna see what driving a car REALLY looks like?
In summary, any event in which I was embarrassed is now non-canon!
I've also retroconned my name to be "Mister Awesome", by the way!
Fancy meeting you here, Dromiceiomimus! Out for a walk in the springtime?
There you are, you jerk! You ate all my cookies last night!
Scotty, I need war speed in three minutes or we're all dead!
Those were my private thoughts! She had no right to tell you!
You've got to help me, Utahraptor! I don't know what to do!
I like to keep my sexual fantasies grounded in good science, thanks!
Yeah, like in the fifties!  Everybody was neighbourly in the fifties!
Off-screen character: Great party, T-rex! Hey, do you have any more chips?
God! But it seems that AS USUAL only I can hear him!
well, it - - um it's not like they wouldn't get paid
So long T-Rex!  I hope you don't become your own grandfather!
Ooh, can I come along on the adventure through time?  Please?
I thought to myself, "T-Rex, you'd better make a note of this!"
Tickets are not transferable. No one else can travel with this ticket.
Hmm... in that case, T-Rex, let's have nachos tonight! It'll be fun!
so anyway, the secret I discovered to being loved is simply -
Then I am sorry but you cannot be in my bluegrass band!
Hey, I wonder if I got any emails while I was out?
Do you mean to imply that T-Rexes are not better than Utahraptors?
Hey, I wonder if I got any emails while I was out?
Do you mean to imply that T-Rexes are not better than Utahraptors?
Homecare is when doctors or nurses visit you in your own home!
I've planted a garden around my house, and it is very pretty!
No: you haven't invited me over since you got your new place.
The only problem is everyone would always (eventually) have the perfect comeback!
Well, I guess you could just restore to an earlier save point.
Dinosaurs were giant reptiles that lived long ago. They looked like this:
Dromiceiomimus, do you think it's cool to do two chicks at once?
I object to the fact that this includes chicks, but excludes dudes!
Surely a little recognition is more than I could ever hope for!
Oh, I see. "Questioning everyone's motives but your own" mode today, huh?
Maybe I'll expect a new format of rebuttal from you next time!
A BRIEF HISTORY OF CHARLES BABBAGE AND HIS WONDERFUL CALCULATING ENGINES COMICS
Uncanny! I seemed to have switched places with my mirror-universe alternate! 
Don't worry! God and I will help you look for your bike!
Almost, but there are still effective limits, therefore: finite number of songs!
It gives me time to think about the movie I just saw.
T-REX FROM THE FUTURE TRAVELS BACK IN TIME TO THIS EXACT MOMENT
T-Rex [[whispers]]: This is a disaster! Dromiceiomimus, you have to help me!
And with my new dance moves, I "tore up the dance floor"!
I should have mentioned that sooner; otherwise, my statement makes less sense.
You, ah - you seem a little more vehement than usual, T-Rex!
Oh, my existential angst! Is there no happiness without knowledge of purpose?
If so, then I propose you join my party, featuring T-Rex! Whoo!
But do you think you could take the party DOWN a notch?
ACTUALLY I THINK THERE'S A DUDE LIKE THAT JUST DOWN THE STREET
Luckily, everything else in the universe has shrunk to the same scale!
Huh? God, my friends aren't crazy. Crazy's insane. My friends are WACKY.
Nope! It's just a talking filing cabinet that undermines the whole book.
You might want to hold off on that trip for a bit!
I too would agree with you re: hot naked people, my friend!
I too would agree with you re: hot naked people, my friend!
The mission to find the treasure, the car chase: all a dream!

They broke up a week later and still had to live together.
Let me just say, "It's good to be back on Earth Prime!"
Alright! New novel: done! This one is a romance, and is called:
Also: how come my bed is so cold and empty at night?
I wonder, did growing up in a small town influence my values?
Okay, but if civilization is destroyed, you and I will have words!
I say largely because I like to keep my options open. Anyway!
Hey T-Rex, is it sexist in here, or is it JUST YOU?
You see the T-Rex, stomping a house. There is a Dromiceiomimus here.
Before you can do anything, you are stepped upon! You have died.
But there's a rude side to me too! It's who I am!
Yes! Remember that little red-scaled dinosaur you had the biggest crush on?
Yes! Remember that little red-scaled dinosaur you had the biggest crush on?
Sucks for them! They won't get any of my SWEET DINOSAUR KISSING.
Okay, everything's fine, except you accidently killed Kayleigh's little brother Tommy! Whoops!
Ryoma doesn't even exist, and yet it's the most disgusting desease ever.
That would be one tough dude! I would rate him, "Super Manly".
It implies that everything I am, everything I think, can be altered!
What?  Whoah, I meant to say "A high five", of course!
As I say, it's analogous to leaving one's phone off the hook.
Early photography does have its own sense of sad nostalgia, doesn't it?
Oh man, I want in! Let's make a documentary about our lives.
You may be right! However: I still think my wit is stellar!
Well, it looks like we've got a Christmas Mystery on our hands!
I'm sorry I was ever mean to you in the past, T-Rex!
You are an awesome dude and we should play beachball sometime soon!
So, I thought I'd cook enough for the next day as well!
The Devil: T-REX WHAT'S GOING ON MAN THINGS ARE PRETTY GREAT EH
There's water in the basement and I don't know what to do!
I wouldn't mind so much, but it makes me feel so old!
No!  Good gosh, this talk belongs in the bedroom, IF ANYWHERE!
I have come up with the best science fiction story idea ever!
But then how would he know when the light is actually on?
Such a nice day! YES, MAYBE A LITTLE BRISK BUT THAT'S OKAY!
HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED THE VIDEO GAME "COMMAND AND CONQUER: RED ALERT"
Sheesh, of course I would! I make jokes about whomever I please!
I discovered some bad news yesterday: my bicycle needs a new seat!

FACTS WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE TRUE ABOUT MOTORCYCLE ENTHUSIASTS COMICS
Utahaptor: Motorcycle enthusiasts tell each other apart by their helmet "street tags"!
Man, I'm getting fed up with fighting these ninjas all the time...
Don't you get fed up with fighting ninjas all the time t-rex?
Raccoons: T-REX, WE PUT OUR MINDS TO IT AND TAUGHT OURSELVES ENGLISH!
Well, maybe they're friendly! Maybe they just want to be your friend?
Raccoons and cephalopods: YOU ALWAYS HAVE SUCH NICE THINGS TO SAY, T-REX.
Seriously! You could be quite imposing to someone who doesn't know you!
I know, but I can't figure out a way to stop that!
Great! Listen, T-Rex, we've known each other for a long time, right?
Oh man, what if people continued skateboarding INSIDE of the crashing helicopter?
Or, does it refer specifically to the persuasion of one's naughty bits?
AMAZINGLY, T-REX AND UTAHRAPTOR SOLVE ALL POSSIBLE ISSUES OF GENDER... BETWEEN PANELS!

It would be really nice to be able to measure that computationally.
Shoot! You know what? I was supposed to feed the dog today!
So are you concerned, T-Rex, that going shopping was your default activity?
So are you going to go? You are their neighbour, after all!
Isn't it CRAZY how young some people are when they get married?
Let's look it up in a dictionary! Then we'll see what's what.
Well!  I'M going to create the first POLITICS-FREE film!  
Further complications: both men look the same!  It's a little weird.
It's cute that these tough guys have no idea what's going on?
Anyway, that's exactly what I intend to do today.  Kindness ahoy!
But come on!  You have to admit that we're the superi-
It sounds like you've put a lot of thought into this, T-Rex!
"I recall we talked about T-Rex a lot," Utahraptor once famously remarked.
Nope! It derives from the Latin "humanus" (earthling), from "humus" (earth, soil)!
Have you ever noticed that summer is when pretty girls come out?
There's probably more things that you can do in an airport, T-Rex!
MAN T-REX YOU'RE ABOUT 3 SECONDS AWAY FROM FATAL RADIATION EXPOSURE YOURSELF
What do you know about building a car out of cardboard, T-Rex?
Not really! Philosophical zombies never even eat the flesh of the living!
You know that Australia is really far away, right?  Super far?
You can start by taking out my garbage for me, good buddy!
That is one dude who's going to get all the sweet makeouts!!
First on the list: "What do you mean you don't love me?"
Yeah, it works especially well if you say it to your girlfriend.
Hey T-Rex, do you want to go see a movie with me?
I also left a big tip, so as not to appear NIGGARDLY!
Eh? Would you say you find something COMMENT-WORTHY in my speech, Dromiceiomimus?
Today is a good day I think for going to all-you-can-eat restaurants!
I do that with all major world religions though! For example, Christianity?
To chase after birds in the park, wearing nothing but a grin!
You must realize that this isn't a fair application of utilitarianism, T-Rex!
THERE IS TOTALLY A PARTY AT THIS HOUSE DOWN THE ROAD TONIGHT
Oh, it's true! The only viable solution is to never speak again!
T-REX NEVER SPEAKS AGAIN... IN THE PARALLEL UNIVERSE WHERE EVERYTHING IS CRAZY!
Aww, don't worry Champ! Not everyone gets it on their first try!
Go ahead, ask me anything.  I bet I'll get it wrong!
Go to school, okay, then university, okay, then get a job -
And I can prove it, too! Ask me how my day was.
Hey God! Check out these awesome pictures I got on my camera!
OKAY T-REX BUT YOU KNOW I AM AWARE OF EVERYTHING EVER RIGHT
OF COURSE IT DOES I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK I'M LAME
Well, why don't you just check to see what others are doing?
It's going to be great!  This is the best idea ev-
How's that?  You've been to the moon like two times yourself!
I know!  It's totally the book I was meant to write!
"HOW TO BE" FAILS TO RULE IN AT LEAST FOUR DIFFERENT WAYS:
And whould faith be held to the rigors of the scientific method?
He says - there's some merit to both sides of the issue?
An insult, AND an implication that my business model is not sound!
Would you say that not even God Himself could tea us apart?
All the music I hear on the radio has lyrics by Timmy!
Ten roasted chickens for dinner? I believe the answer is "Heck yes!"
I really need to think long and hard about my life decisions.
Okay! Okay, FINE.  I'll tell ONE embarrassing secret and that's it!
Hey T-Rex, do you want to hang out on New Year's Eve?
I recently heard about an event called the Race For The Cure!
I sometime wonder if I've become too dependent on my daily routine.
Since I stomp the girl every day, she represents my daily routine.
Your metaphors for changing seem to be a thinly-veiled attempt not to.
(open mouth) I wonder what that stands for.  "Overly Competent Dinosaur"
Irony and Nostalgia are no longer "In". The big thing now...... Stomping!
If you love him so much then why don't you marry him?
That seems more like an excuse for group sex than actual science.
RPGs sound like nerd games that nerds play! With - with nerds!
Awww! Really? You'd give up being a reanimated corpse for our friendship?
We've built a whole system around ethics and you're questioning its foundation!
Nope, because there'd be a second UPSIDE DOWN trampoline too, man! Kapow!
Is that why you're on my nose?  To look for food?
She blew all of our fake-ass phoney regrets out of the water!
Neighbours: WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN US IN SOME ILLEGAL DRUGS, NEIGHBOUR?
BACKSTORY: T-REX IS WORRIED HE'S NOT AS AFFLUENT AS HE SHOULD BE?
Two words that are homophones sound the same but mean different things!
Dromiceiomimus, you'll bid on naked pictures of me, right?  For profits?
And with that I'm off to go have a bath or something.
Sure they can, T-Rex!  You see new things, and there's danger.
Aw, T-Rex, you'd be one of those guys with deliberate facial hair?
"T-Rex: That Awful Taste in your Mouth, First Thing in the Morning"
SOME SUGGEST THAT VIDEO GAMES SHOULD TELL STORIES LIKE FILMS OR BOOKS
You raise some good points.  However, you forget one crucial thing.
Aw man, are you infecting us right now?? Go back to bed!
But I thought we - we could get through this disease... together?
Yeah, actually that's somehting I'm not very clear on. Are we dating?
Do you know who really did invent the fire extinguisher though, T-Rex?
Have I, perhaps, solved the "Valentine's Day Problem" once and for all?
Huh! I actually hadn't considered ironic valentines, which I do like. Hmm...
And what if someone wants you to be their valentine for real?
Right.  Well "#8212; I've never really been one for "apt analogies".
Hey, I bet if I ignore him, it will arouse a reaction!
Thesis statement: science fiction is a better genre of fiction than fantasy.
That seems to have many of the same limitations as Method #1!
The first is to go further in something than anyone has before!
Hah!  Looks like you'd better be EXTRA nice to us then!
A private room? Oh man, were you just namedropping M.C. MASTURBATION? 
Friends, I have good news!  The answer is no longer 'no'!
But Dromiceiomimus, there's also being bianxious.  And being bitraumatized!  BISCANDALIZATION.
What's happening to me? I feel so different all of a sudden!
T-Rex (thinking): Aren't analogies usually non-literal? He's clearly the gem diamond trade.
So it's like a pet, but instead of being cute, it pollutes?
You know what?  I find the existence of those plans DOUBTFUL.
I call it, "I Know! I'll Ask T-Rex About My Stupid Problems!"
Only in the drug slang sense, which I'm probably inventing right now!
INDEED IT IS AKIN TO A VIRTUOSO PIANO PERFORMANCE IN EVERY REGARD
Yeah, I mean, I get what you're doing, but what's the point?
Man, such slander!  You're parents should have named YOU "Sweeps Week".
Time to go back in time and visit the CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION.
Theory: probably just an attempt to somehow pick up chicks by T-Rex?
But everyone would demand you do favours in exchange for inventory items!
Yeah man! And I think the student in question was - GREEN??
Then why do I suddenly FEEL hungry, hmm?  Riddle me that!
LATER, T-REX IS TRYING TO DISCOVER ESSEN
