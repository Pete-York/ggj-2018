T-Rex, come on, this is ultra dumb.
I've never felt worse for inventing someone!
But everyone wanted to be an astronaut!

I don't know - a few dollars?
This is going to be so great!
T-Rex's thoughts: Grandmoms are great for that!

People with synesthesia BASICALLY have super powers.
So what are you going to do?
So, Utahraptor!  What do you think?
It - it came in the mail?

It's a measurement of food energy, T-Rex!
You would, my friend! You would indeed.
It sounds like you've got allergies, T-Rex!
I do actually think that's pretty manly.
I dunno.  Probably because it's awesome!
Fine. Utahraptor, what's your manliness man then?
Amazing!  I feel the same way!!

Whoo!  Let's get this conversation started!
You can never have too much pie!
Yeah, it will probably cause a mistrial!

Listen though, don't tell my mom, okay?
That's a bicycle pun, by the way!
(You can use it if you want!)
Right, Dromiceiomimus? I'm a good poet, right?
Your poetry sounds a little political, T-Rex!
Why? You're living every teenage boy's fantasy!

You could say it like, "Curiosity: SATISFIED!"
No refunds are permitted on this fare.
I notice you're using the past tense!
Yes indeed.  I'm experimenting with it.
You're experimenting with using inappropriate verb tenses.
Mad enough to stomp on a house?
I do that anyway; you know that!
Hey, I heard you were pissed off!
Do you want to talk about it?
What's your opinion on the issue, T-Rex?
The interest dates back to my childhood!

I GOT A CELL PHONE YOU KNOW
Could one, in time, become the other?
I'm pretty sure you're the only one!
Really? Huh! Nobody else finds pretzels stimulating?
You mean the "dinosaur factor", of course!
But without money people would still trade!
And you recognize the double standard here?
ok then, chillin', chillin', mindin' my business
What? No! It's not sexist in here!
I wrote some fan fiction last night!
I don't know how to "god damn".

The craziest thing happened to me yesterday!
No thank you! It was too CRAZY.
Well, I don't see why not. 
That's so sad!  That's profoundly sad!
Tonight I am going to bed early.
Cause I'm going to bed early tonight!
IT WAS SUBTLE IRONY. Sheesh, everyone! Subtlety!
Hooray for potential Christmas smooching, my friend!

But wimpy guys talk about women too!
The Devil! What are you doing here?!

Well, you talk like you are, sometimes!
Yep! As I say, it makes sense.
