LOOKS LIKE PEOPLE WILL JUST REMEMBER YOU FOR TALKING A BIG GAME MY FRIEND
Or maybe you have to wait longer for a book to turn a profit!
AW MAN - NOW WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH ALL THESE RAISED EXPECTATIONS
Ah, that makes perfect sense! Thanks, T-Rex! Now I know how digital timers work.
Morris: oh hello there t-rex! it's super nice to see a friendly face today
Morris: i guess i'm probably off your christmas card list this year, huh t-rex

the dinosaur comic players answer: WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU HAD THREE WISHES
Um - a dilemma is for two choices: you had a trilemma there. Precision!
To shoot some dudes, turn to panel 5! You probably wanna shoot some dudes.
Or predisposition, anyways. The point is that this hot weather makes me feel great!
TO TURN BACK TIME AND LIVE AGAIN WITH YOUR SWEETIE, TURN TO PANEL 6.
Dromiceiomimus comes back today! I'm so happy I could step on a tiny woman!
If you trash something, you might say, "Daaamn! I just totalled my own legs!!"
Mozart! I SAID to watch me for the changes and try to keep up!
Aw, man!! Am I a dude who gets turned on by descrambling an egg?
Why is that bothering you? You've never cared what I think, you inconsistent bastard!
Dromiceiomimus!  I'm turned on by scrambled eggs spontaneously climbing back into the shell!
But it's not my fault!  I just have such good ideas for erotica.
Being hung over is like winning the lottery, except they pay you in regret!
We'll talk and go on adventures even though we're all in diapers! So, yes!
This severely undermines what I said to Utahraptor, but I find I cannot resist!
T-REX I'M LATE FOR SOMETHING SO I'M JUST GONNA ANSWER YOUR MOST RECENT QUESTION
Floating Batman Head: also always remember how i could beat superman in a fight.
Hey sweetie / that sex was neat / although we weren't / exactly discreet.
Hey sexy / that sex was great! / It is how / we procreate!

The book is called, "A Plane Saved Them, And You Should Have Seen It."
I bet I can get AT LEAST three more movies out of this premise!
Today is a good day I think for pointing out the failures of others!
Book Cover Text: they go on for SO long and we all get tired
Aw, T-Rex!  I don't want to just tell you to buy me something.
Has there ever been a situation in which a tiger has eaten a penguin?
Doug: When he arises, inform him his friend Doug would have words with him.
What about Gone With The Friggin' Wind, Casa-Friggin'-Blanca, and It's A Friggin' Wonderful Life?
Maybe after the subs sandwiches we could go to a water lake beach shore?
I'm glad you like it! What, uh, what was it I got you again?
All you're doing is talking about delicious punch. Why not just go get some?
He said it to his dog because snowbody loved him. He had snow friends!
Two attractive people meet and fall in love. Then they take baths and hug.
YES HE IS. HE'S IN LOVE WITH YOU AND HE WANT TO KISS YOU.
THEN HE WANT TO MAKE SOME OF THE SEX WITH YOU. THAT'LL BE NICE.
Um, okay: "Just one, but it doesn't matter: they'll never see the light anyway."
Man what's the deal with nobody hearing you but me, God? It's a hassle!
Monocle Guy: I'm not allowed to punch back because that would be animal cruelty!
"Nurses take care of the injured, but they injure who they take care of."
I am Captain Renault!  I'm a corrupt French official but I'm totally likeable.
Well Utahraptor, AS YOU KNOW, any sufficiently-advanced music player will be indistinguishable from magic.
They represented my selfish excitement to show her off in front of my friends!
They represented my selfish excitement to show her off in front of my friends!
Friend: So yeah, notes that are higher tend to be brighter colours for me!
And it happened to be a forum in which I use my real name!
T-Rex's Mental Text: Aw darn, I totally did that.  What should I do?
The slogan will be, "Yes.  You can skateboard in your apartment in winter."
This is just a picture of Richard the Third's head on Duke Nukem's body.
Right, and you could probably find history teachers to take the more common artifacts!
Ted's so great. I just want to hang out with him all day long!
T-REX HAS MET A MAN WHOSE VOICE SOUNDS JUST LIKE A TEXT-TO-SPEECH SYNTHESIZER! NEAT
What he has, Dromiceiomimus, is a gift! The gift is labelled "best accent ever".
For most of his life he documented the disappearing "great race" of the Indian!
It's difficult to reconcile the events in this song with established Beach Boys canon
A lot of people seem to have trouble separating actors from their roles. 
That's true!  I just wish we knew more about the man, you know?
SHAKESPEARE!  OH SHAKESPEARE!  DO YOU KNOW WHERE MY CAR KEYS ARE, SHAKESPEARE
Instead of looking for dates, you could scour your memories for missed romantic opportunities!
TINY BLACK HOLES COULD BURROW INTO YOUR BODIES, EATING YOU FROM THE INSIDE OUT.
OR EVERY ATOM IN YOUR BODY COULD LOSE ITS COHESION AND YOU COULD EXPLODE.
I'm not sure if one guy can change the way language is used, T-Rex!
Let's see! Hours of unpaid labour, heavy lifting, getting to see all your laundry...
Nope! But that's because *I* happen to use a little friggin' thing called "tips"!
1st Off-page voice: Guys! I think he's using body language to criticize our idea!!
Oooh, what's this, a sheep?  What are you going to do, PUNCH ME?
Um... Genghis II and Romeo IV decide... to take you all to the fair!
Dr. Doctor: As I said before, I believe you may have a hairline fracture.
You just have to follow it up with "I like that in a woman"!
Librarian: Yes sir! We have books on many topics, here at your local library!
What about people who hear God tell them to "lose a few pounds, chubbs"?
It sounded like the sound dogs make when they're just about to throw up.
I wonder if there is an essential "feminine", one that transcends histories and cultures?
Guys!  My romance novel still has a terminal case of the totally sucks!
Then there can't be sexy times at all.  That's not a bad idea!
Honestly, I think your theory is a little pat. It doesn't consider all possibilities!
I wonder what things would be like if I could READ MY FRIEND'S THOUGHTS??
There's no way you could know what punctuation I was using! There's NO WAY.
Yep!! And I'm going to walk over there and talk to him right now!
Well, honestly, T-Rex, I think that it's INCREDIBLY presumptuous of you to say that.
He shows up again in the epilogue! Utahraptor! You didn't even finish my book!
I'm really looking forward to the little soiree I've got lined up for tonight...
I'm sorry T-Rex, but something came up. But say "hi" to everyone for me!
In fact, someone drew Dromiceiomimus and a house and a car in MY kitchen!
LATER, T-REX AND UTAHRAPTOR GO DOWN IN HISTORY FOR BEING THE WORLD'S SUCKIEST GREEKS:
Maybe I will, Utahraptor! MAYBE I'LL ENJOY POOPING MY PANTS EACH AND EVERY DAY!!
Speed theme: check. Spider theme: check! Iron Man theme: TOTALLY CHECKED. There's nothing left!
Furthermore, if I didn't have my sense of humour, chicks would like me less!
That name is totally made up. It was made up by a Scottish Enthusiast.
ANYWAY T-REX NEVER INJURED HIMSELF THAT DAY AND THE POWERS WORE OFF SOON AFTER
When people say they are looking for God, they do not mean it literally!
T-REx, I've always wondered: how do you ride a bike with your tine ar-
So where are the cuts? You should have at least a little road rash.
They're all, um, on my opposite side with now. The side you can't see.
My brother and his kid are coming over. A quiet night in, you know?
Offscreen: Um, I'm just a telemarketer who wants to sell you some long distance?
Yes! Maybe if you stopped leaving your used-up socks in the kitchen or whatever?
Today is a good day I think for riddles! And hey, look at me!
Yep!  You know what?  I'm not even fully sure what taxes ARE.
People like different songs because they have different tastes in music. This I concede.
Hey God, you know on Star Trek, when sometimes they go back in time?
Okay. Good. Alright, I'm going to go back to talking about Star Trek now.
LATER, T-REX DISCOVERS THAT 80S REFERENCES WORKED INTO CONVERSATION INSPIRE HIM MORE THAN ANYTHING!
TODAY IS THE DAY I SHARE MORE ABOUT MYSELF THAN MAYBE I WANTED TO
A FILM 1000 YEARS FROM NOW BEING ON THAT LIST NOW THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING
That's right, Utahraptor!  I'll say I'm friends with Hitler to win an argument!!
From now on he's Fubs! His SUBTITLE is The Angriest Dog in the World.
Dromiceiomimus (off screen): T-Rex?! What are you doing here? It's late! It's 3 AM!
I've got one thing to say, Dromiceiomimus!  Do you know what it is?
The Devil: ALTERNATIVELY SHOULD YOU CHOOSE THE GENESIS I HAVE PREPARED AN EXCELLENT ESSAY-RESPONSE
I have come up with an excellent way to celebrate Hallowe'en: a date auction!
I think I'll never be this excited again for the rest of my life.
And except for the fact that we can't just decide to stop making mistakes.
Neat! So you're wandering around being all agog at electricity and airplanes and stuff!
Let us bask in the afterglow a bit before rolling over and kissing Christmas!
Perhaps you missed the scenario in which I use it to blow up... pollution?
What?  Screw that!  MY DISPOSABLE INCOME IS ALL EARMARKED FOR ONE PURPOSE!
Today is the day I realize that saying something "rocks" is actually really weird!
Have all minds within the sound of my voice been COMPLETELY AND IRREVOCABLY BLOWN??
In my heart of hearts, I truly thought we already had such an accord
So in that case I should choose 2/3rds of THAT, which is - 44.44?
...then I keep taking 2/3rds off that number until I end up at 0.
Everyone knows it but they leave it to ME to say it out loud!
THEIR dictionary, not THE dictionary! There's like 80 billion words they've never heard about.
"Boo hoo this is tasty boo hoo I'm also enjoying this sex as well"?
Ah.  So we're still burning through oil much faster than it's being formed.
Love is just a feeling! A CHEMICAL STATE. We don't need to deify it!
Offscreen: If I agree that doesn't mean i have to produce it though right?
Beneath an "I'M WITH STUPID" shirt, wear another one that says "NO, NOT REALLY".
Domiceiomimus: It's time for us to not just break the ice, but smash it?
It takes over our minds, our bodies! How do you fight something like that?
Okay but the first time actually someone uses that word the world will end!
I'm filled with wonder and awe at the most casual display of nature's beauty!
But any character can pull that off.  It doesn't have to be Shakespeare.
Did you know that St. Patrick used to be associated with the color BLUE?
That's like solving a problem of high blood pressure by removing the heart, T-Rex!
ACTUALLY NO I DIDN'T BUT I SAID I DID BECAUSE OF APRIL FOOLS' DAY
Hey, here's a fact! Power ballads are the best sort of ballads. FACT. 
How is it racist? Is the apple-hater of a minority creed or socio-economic group?
One day your parents had INSANELY EPIC SEX, and then later, you showed up?
Today is a good day I think for thanking my friends for their friendship!
Voice: T-Rex, I want you to meet my friend Gary. Gary, this is T-Rex.
But then every time you'd eat something, you'd have no idea how it'll taste!
Uncanny! All my memories are flooding back in a torrent of life and history!
And I remember this tiny woman! I remember I liked to stomp on her!
You can barbecue vegetables, T-Rex. I'll bring some vegetables and I'll show you how!
Today is a good day I think for going for - oh shoot! 
Hello everybody!  If you stopped having relationships, maybe you'd stop having relationship problems!
[[off-panel]]: So you'd say that it's what... 20 degrees of Pure Class out today?
But T-Rex, this is nothing more than deifying the ego, defiant of conventional morality!
I didn't invent it! I am merely the excitable spokesman for the concept presently.
Monocle guy: I'm not allowed to punch back because that would be animal cruelty!
Monocle guy: I'm not allowed to punch back because that would be animal cruelty!
Oh great, you're gonna be Mr. "I've Given Up Drinking And Am Therefore Superior"!
OH HECK TAKE YOUR PICK FROM CANCER AND HEART DISEASE AND STROKE AND ACCIDENTS
Off panel: Wow, personal jetpacks are so compact, efficient, safe AND easy to control!!
Perhaps instead you'd like to purchase "Self-interested Bear", "Shorn Cyclist", or "BEACH BUNNY CHURCHILL"??
I think that this has been successful so far. Let us continue this experiment!
Ah, yes, that coveted "I'm so full of chalk and sawdust, you guys" feeling.
That implies giving a depressed dude a few bucks will cheer him right up.
AND IT'D BE EASIER FOR ME T-REX IF I COULD CONVERSE WITH SHIGERU MIYAMOTO
IN THE FUTURE, we'll solve the old problems but we'll also have new problems.
Utahraptor, that's brilliant! Oh my gosh. My lifelong dream can finally now be realized!
Why, hello there, Utahraptor! Wouldn't you say I sound like a young Cary Grant?
I'm looking for excitement! But so far it's been pretty much a "bust". 
CLEARLY WHEN THERE'S ONLY ONE GRAIN OF SAND LEFT IT'S NOT A HEAP ANYMORE
Man, now I'M the bad guy for not honoring debts in a timely manner?
[[T-Rex imagines tiny Batman head on left talking to tiny Spider-man head on right]]
But what if I... dressed up like a flapper, and said "Here's the news?"
But what if I... dressed up like a flapper, and said "Here's the news?"
Maybe it's a good idea that people don't live forever. Rhetorical people, I mean!
Leitwortstil is the purposeful repetition of words or phrases in a story, you guys!
Dromiceiomimus (from outside the panel): I'm sure there's not a BILLION of them, T-Rex.
Our slogan is "Hi, you are probably already a member of our awesome club!"
I know! AND they get to be referred to by the mass noun "elderlies"!
I believe that particular point would have been better off remaining a subtle irony.
Maybe there IS actually a personal benefit to being mortal and dying one day.
Did you know you can find instructions for making a bomb on the interweb?
Sounds like you should be taking this up with your brain, not with me!
The Devil: AND LET US ENSURE THE CORE GAMEPLAY MECHANIC IS PRESENT AND UNMOLESTED
The wall hit you, but "decide" is misleading! The wall didn't make any decisions.
If I were you I'd be polite when they show up with a cake!
If I were you I'd be polite when they show up with a cake!
Today I made peace with the possibility that some people might enjoy being wrong.
Surveys are kinda baloney, you guys! They're kinda phoney baloney to the ultimate max.
But - I stayed up all night working on the celebrated and unmentionable Nutrinomicon.
Assuming they've removed the 5-day waiting period on me changing my name, that is!!
So in your story, Adam and Eve hang out in paradise, alone, inventing cement.
If I can't be a bog person, I can be the next best thing!
Sure, I'll give you that. Why make such a big deal about this though?
What the hell was he talking about? I've got the insurance papers right here!
Why no - besides going out with a strapping young man such as yourself!
Oh no! I'm so worried! What if people can't tell when I'm being sarcastic?
In fact - more like category fun!  This is going to be awesome!
I received an invitation via the post last night!  A very exclusive invitation...
Whatever, man!  I bet I won't be the only one taking a picture!
That's what the book says, anyway. It's not anti-monogamy, but it is pro-polygamy. 
Man, did you see what that Triceratops was wearing at the film last night?
But as not to appear nerdy, I told everyone that I went out "clubbing"!
It was great! I had a great time dancing with, uh, three different women!
Dromiceiomimus, you look delicious today! I would love to have you for dinner tonight!
No! Because they will eat YOU and cut you up with their pointy toenails!
I tell you man, I was all over the logic books in high school!
Which means, of course, that I had better get started working on my costume!
T-Rex, stop it!  You can't just go around putting words in people's mouths!
Writing free-form poetry is easy, if you just write whatever pops into your head!
No, I'm Superman!  Clark Kent and I are two different people!  
In fact, it's quite the opposite. The phrase originated with pilots of fighter planes!
Dromiceiomimus, would you like to come over tonight for a big "American Thanksgiving" dinner?
Suddenly I feel as if my future is full of new choices, new directions!
Forget it! I'm sick of everybody acting like they know what's best for me!
Well that explains why that woman at the supermarket never replied to my letters!
What larger trend are you possibly talking about? The trend of theatres being full?
Then I'll go out and buy these gifts! I will do this using CAPITALISM.
Dromiceiomimus, If you could have anything in the whole world, what would you want?
COMICS IN WHICH THE MAIN CHARACTER IS TIRED OF PUNS AND SO EVERYBODY DIES
COMICS IN WHICH THE MAIN CHARACTER IS TIRED OF PUNS AND SO EVERYBODY DIES
Why are you listing things that don't exist? You could be here, literally, forever!
I wonder what the world would be like if I had never been born!
I do. "Merry Christmas!" What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.
So - what?  It's a machine that is happy?  A happy robot?
But what happens if the happy machine fails?  If it breaks into pieces?
Well, to be fair, that IS one of the differences between adults and children!
Is that true? Could others take my offer of prizes to be an insult?
But what if someone you know reads it? What if your MOM reads it?
Dromiceiomimus, should I stomp this house FAST, or should I stomp this house SLOW?
I have finally decided to add another word to my List of Favourite Words!
This domain name will have to be something that reflects me and my interests!
Oh, I only smoke once in a while, and only when I've been drinking.
Am I a prude? Am I out of touch with the youth of today?
I, lovable, scaly old T-Rex am the dinosaur at the end of this comic!
SUDDENLY, THIS COMIC'S PUNCHLINE, AND THAT OF THE SYNDICATED COMIC STRIP "CATHY", ARE SWITCHED!
Yeah, what if we all say "He's good, but he smells funny on Tuesdays?"
Yeah, what if we all say "He's good, but he smells funny on Tuesdays?"
LATER THE UTAHRAPTOR USES THE MIND-CONTROL RAY ON HIMSELF, AND BECOMES... A KINDER PERSON!
This is MY town - a dirty town, but I'm gonna clean it up...
That's it Rex! You're a loose cannon and I want your gun and badge!!
I can't believe that I didn't see that obvious flaw in my new philosophy!*
Really! How much thought did you put into stepping on that woman just now?*
Why, I still take immense pleasure in stomping on this conveniently placed log cabin.
In spring you get flowers popping up, new fresh air, young lovers walking hand-in-hand...
I stranded him on a planet years ago, and he never forgets a face!
Then I'll engage the Genesis device and blow us both out of the sky!
Boxing! The word is a seventeenth-century alliteration of 'fisty' (of the fists) and 'cuff'!
You haven't thought this through! You're just interested in fisticuffs because of the name!
Yep! I made drinks and set up lawn chairs and even a croquet set!
Utahraptor, a skeleton went into a bar and ordered a beer and a mop!
"Bicuriosity: satisfied"?  More like, "Bicuriosity: disappointed by a fumbling and frankly clumsy grope!"
Or MAYBE all my friends are tourists from the future, sent to observe me!
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called B el-Air!
We recommend that sufficient insurance be purchased to cover all of your travel requirements.
Yes. I will be honest with you: I am new to this "band" thing.
Yes, you, T-REX. Somebody's eaten my food and whenever that happens it's always you.
Outta my way, kid! I'm a thief fleeing from a crime I just committed!
But we'd be stuck in a certain time period, because people would never die!
"Oh boy, I see in the distance a villag- CITY that I can destroy!"
Ah, 'tis something soothing to discover yourself engaged in something you very much enjoy.
Morbidly funny image, though - makes you wonder what they were all doing there.
To be free we must give ourselves up to being totally protean and chameleonic!
Computers store information in binary code, which is a series of 1s and 0s!
But, being really cool IS one of the perks of being a computer scientist!
Okay, so we covered how everything in a computer is stored in binary code!
You're a dying breed, my friend! There are only a few credit watchers left!
Utahraptor, it's you!  You're back from the alternate universe!  But... something's different...
Dear recipient of this comic, whoever sent this to you thinks you are great!
Excuse me! Everybody? Would you say it's true that life is a neoclassical pastiche?
This is not much help to people who do not have such coquettish flair!
But I'm beginning to suspect that the dance moves were in me all along!
To clarify, I meant to imply that the King of the Dance was self-taught!
Alternate Universe Utahraptor: And then afterwards we'll discuss philosophy or something like that, OK?
Presentism is when you interpret the historical past with a view from the present!
This gives me an idea! My idea is what I was just talking about!
I was just wondering if it bothers you when I senselessly step on people.
The school is burning down! Quick, we need your help to fight the fire!
SERIOUSLY MAN JUST DO IT AND I PROMISE I'LL YOU A COSMIC TRUTH AFTERWARDS
I'm not sure we'd even be able to UNDERSTAND a joke God would make!
Alright everyone! There's no need for any more haiku: the art form has peaked!
AND IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS, "A NIGHT FOR MURDER" TAKES JAPAN BY STORM!
Rebuilt again, eh? I'll have to make a note of that, in my LOGS!
Huh! Well, tell you what. I'll stomp on her first, then you go, OK?
That's very resp - actually, T-Rex, that's exactly as responsible as you should be.
... and bring it to term with a surrogate mother who is herself married!
Be careful though! Overplay this, and you may become separated from your familiar world!
Congratulations on your book becoming the entire world's Global Narrative and Shared History, T-Rex!
Well - it's hard to remove the "human factor" from any evaluation like this.
I guess you could say your remarks are. . . RIGHT ON THE MONEY?
But I like emotions, T-Rex!  I like feeling happy and content and loved!
Indeed I did, good sir! And may I just say, "smoochie smoochie"? Hah hah!
Well, you're in luck! I ran into one of the old neighbourhood kids today!
Well, you're in luck! I ran into one of the old neighbourhood kids today!
Like you're trying to lead someone on, goading them into burying you alive. 
What the heck?  A thigh five?  Where did that even come from?
Hey there Utahraptor! Have I ever told you that you're a prints among men?
Hey! Yeah! I'll make my own magazine! AND it'll be my magazine for TEENS!
Hey! Yeah! I'll make my own magazine! AND it'll be my magazine for TEENS!
That doesn't make it good though! Lots of Christmas themed stuff is REALLY BAD.
YEARS LATER, THE PRESENTS ARE GONE, BUT THE PLASTIC BAGS HAVE YET TO BIODEGRADE!
I can't help it if no cannibalism is less memorable than tons of cannibalism!
Oh ho! Did I just do that on purpose? AM I REALLY THAT CLEVER??
On the other hand, I thought "feeling blue" tied into the water theme well!
whoa whoa whoa!  T-Rex!  Nobody wants to hear about your lovemaking 'technique'!
And as a non-chump, this means I must find a way to be immortal!
That way we ALL get to live forever without breaking any universal laws! Watch!
Wait, WAIT! We'll never be able to become unfrozen, because that action requires time!!
You think that if you shout "woo!" enough, a party will form, don't you?
A horse walks into a bar and the bartender says "why the long face?"
Professor Utiarty: Ah, but you see, as easily as I can swap my monocle..
Hah hah!  I don't believe it!  T-Rex - you're afraid of raccoons!
Yes, well - I realize that now, Utahraptor, and it makes me very Sad!
But doesn't it take more than simply listing old things to really be nostalgic?
T-REX YOUR COMPANION IS CLEARLY UNFAMILIAR WITH MY PROWESS IN THE REALM OF MMORPGS
"I had a bit of a crush on her too! She was a cutie."
"Pretty nice?" "Are you worried that one day you'll forget what it was like?"
I also believe that it's NOT nice to be insincere. I am in conflict!
Today is a good day I think for more SECRETS of the MEDICAL PROFESSION!
HEY T-REX IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THINGS INTERESTING THIS CONVERSATION TOTALLY ISN'T HELPING
COMPRESSED THESIS COMICS: today's thesis: "Computational Measures of the Acceptability of Light Verb Constructions"
Light verb constructions (LVCs) are constructions like "take a stroll" and "give a smile"!
It's a necessary tradeoff! Millions of people specialize and make tiny contributions to knowledge.
That's creepy! That's odd! That's OFF. Who indiscriminately invites people to a slumber party?
I think maybe you should go! How bad could it be? They're your NEIGHBOURS.
So it's essentially unknowable to me unless I had married at that age myself...Hmm...
WE JOIN T-REX AFTER THE EYE DOCTOR HAS TOLD HIM HE MIGHT NEED GLASSES:
Hah, the next thing you know, I'll have a wacky but non-threatening gay frien-
Machine Intelligences: T-REX IF YOU TELL ANYONE ABOUT US THEN YOU WILL BE ELIMINATED
Hah hah, okay, you got me! I was just fooling. Good one though, eh?
Aw man!  Why people always got to ram their cars into my house?
I think I agree, T-Rex! This is the worst kind of kissing and telling.
O.A.C. stands for "on approved credit"!  Everyone's approved if they're approved?!  Aaargh!
W- Okay! Okay! Sheesh. Now I'm in a bad mood, thanks to you. Satisfied?
MAKING UP STORIES THAT ARE WRONG BUT HING THAT YOU DO KNOW THE TRUTH:
Philosophical zombies? Do you mean like a zombie Plato or Ayn Rand or something?
HEY T-REX I BET YOU COULDN'T EAT 12 SALTINE CRACKERS IN UNDER A MINUTE
Hey Dromiceiomimus, do you think that I could be forgiven? I wish you would!
I think that there's no animal more symbolic than birds.  They're so SAD!
T-REX DECIDES NOT TO KISS ANYONE FOR A MONTH TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE:
Well maybe he just decided to write a book that he entirely disagreed with.
You'll notice that one of my nipples is highlighted in several of the pictures!
Our current understanding of physics says what you are trying may well be impossible!
Aw boo! Researching things, much like the mental illness of depression, is for chumps!
Whoah, T-Rex! Use your indoor voice - you don't have to be so loud!
What are you talking about? You don't have a job in the first place!
I don't think that fixed ANYTHING, man! Things are as messed up as ever!
Also, my head hurts and I feel like making puns involving the word "watch"!
As a T-Rex, I appreciate being able to gorge myself for one low price.
Some religious scholars believe she and the historical Jesus were more than "just friends"?
Especially since it was destroyed by fire or maybe looting a few centuries later.
Science is based upon hypotheses, conclusions and theories formed via repeated observations and experiments!
You know what would answer the very important question of "who is the manliest?"
I'm so manly that I pound nails into the wall with my bare hands!
What do you call fifteen PROFESSION MEMBERS buried up to their necks in sand?
And yet, I do it freely!! That's because I live on the edge, Utahraptor.
That's a terrible thing to say, T-Rex! You can't blame a BABY for crying!
No man! I love babies! Some of my best friends used to be babies!
Why would you even say that?! I'm the only one that can hear you!
IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IS IT ETHICAL TO COPY AND EMULATE THE GAME IN QUESTION
Man I'll leave you to it! I'm going elsewhere to have an INTERESTING conversation.
Ouch, man! What went wrong? Can we no longer trust a stranger's helping hand?
I gave them to my mother for her birthday!  What a good son!
Ahh!  Oh my God!  THAT WAS NOT EXCITING OR ROMANTIC AT ALL!!
Was there a real-life Confucius, T-Rex, or is he merely a convenient fictional device?
My stars, do I ever love documentary films.  The best form of filmmaking?
It is a great way to subtly undermine your subject without saying a word.
I am Rose, your fated lover! Let us enjoy ourselves in this consequence-free environment!
Here is a startling thought: what if the things I believe in are wrong?
Here is a list of things that were once totally cool and remain so:
I've decided to start speaking in PERL more often! It's my favorite computer language!
Irony.  Haven't you heard? It's cool to do things you no longer enjoy.
That's pretty sweet, T-Rex! But you don't think you'd get tired of it? Eventually?
I guess the only safe one would be if the paper said "old age".
Neighbours: ONE TIME, T-REX, WE ALL GOT SO HIGH WE STARTED CANNIBALIZING EACH OTHER
Ah well, it had a good run.  Now onto the next new thing!
Wait! Wait a minute! I never had a chance to use it for real!
Qui dit que vous ?tes responsable du moment o? les choses deviennent "vieux chapeau"?
The only time I can imagine using it is - well, when describing you.
I for one would like to register disappointment with every aspect of the future?
FOR EXAMPLE: T-Rex is a pretty sweet dude because he's always so friggin' awesome!
NO IT DOES NOT.  What it suggests is that everybody sucks but me!
T-Rex if you get a drink of water then you won't be thirsty anymore.
It sure is great that everyone everywhere has safe access to clean drinking water!
I think if you REALLY want to show me up, your course is clear!
Everyone needs to stop walking in on me while I'm having a shower, please!
I really don't think it would be that fetching a look on you, T-Rex!
Nightmares aren't really that great, T-Rex.  Bad things happen to people you like.
"T-Rex: Like Waking Up Covered in Someone Else's Blood, But In A Good Way"
We go back and forth sending "I got your 'I got it'" letters forever!
Oh man, this is just another one of your dumb postal service conspiracy theories!!
No, I've just never heard reincarnation including things that, you know - aren't alive.
Alright! Who here has some emotional problems they'd like solved once and for all?
{{thinking}} Why do they call it "lactose intolerant"? They should call it, "lactose inconsiderate".
But that's more a definition of happiness than a guide to achieving it, T-Rex!
Everybody wants to be remarkable!  Here are some awesome ways to be remarkable:
So you'd move to a new town just to start a life of LIES?
She's just sadly staying at home, Utahraptor! Man! She's probably regretting things RIGHT NOW!
See? I've stomped hundreds of humans and nothing ever happens but a satisfying "squish".
I have the brash enthusiasm of an amateur and the body of a tyrannosauroid!
Wait, did I say "my target"? I mean my soulmate! My sweetheart. My mark!
And you could make it even sadder by turning the boy into a puppy!
The POINT, my friend, is - that you should come over for dinner tonight?
Here's something that I, T-Rex the talking dinosaur, have trouble believing in: true love!
Hey, since when do you come up with such nice analogies for true love?
Whoa, you get back pain? Mr. "I'm So Tough I Barely Miss Having Feelings?"
You COULD stop it if you had absolute dominion over time and space, T-Rex.
You can't really live your life in fear of bad things happening, my friend!
Like how Alexander Graham Bell and that other dude both independently invented the telephone!
Wouldn't it be totally neat if life was more like a text-based adventure game?
And then, after we all get the new bikes, do you know what happens?
T-REX HAD SOME CRAZY DREAMS LAST NIGHT AND HEY, HE'S STILL TALKING ABOUT THEM
I heard that parents should lock up their turkeys, because you'll punch them out!
Love isn't allowed because it's TOO OBVIOUS.  What's the strongest non-love emotion, Dromiceiomimus?
Man, forget this! I take back some of the things I said about civilization!
And then the dude would be like, "IT'S TOO AWESOME MY MIND IS BREAKING"?
I respect how you've made a career out of it, yet, it's still gross!
If you want that sort of  thing you'll have to go to hell.
MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX HAS BEEN STEALING HELICOPTERS SINCE HE WAS EIGHT:
