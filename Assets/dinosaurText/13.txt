I hope the Utahraptor is around here somewhere! My legs are giving tired.
Hey everyone! You know what needs more jokes? ONLY EVERY RELIGIOUS TEXT EVER!!
I know for a fact that on e of those doesn't exist, T-Rex!
That was an extremely hilarious joke that deserved more laughter than it received.
(She called them "glasses" but you can tell she was thinking "nerd goggles"!)
I guess we can only hope that the insect kingdom never becomes zombified?
I'm pretty sure you're not actually undead, Morris! Normally zombies can't talk. 
It sounds a little like there's a bunch of female cannibals eating you.
When multinationals do well, I usually feel like that's bad news for me.

IF YOU MESS UP AGAIN PEOPLE WON'T THINK YOU'RE GOOD AT TALKING ANYMORE
a choose your own adventure comic that also solves all your relationship problems
Also, many of the signs are really evocative, so they're easy to remember!
Um - I have nothing bad to say about sign language, the end!
Another beautiful hot day! I look forward to these "dog days" of summer.
Hey, have you ever gotten emails from people who do that with EMOTICONS?
Anyway, yes, due to tidal acceleration, the moon IS slowing down the Earth!
There is no hope at all. Soon even the supermassive black holes evaporate.
Dromiceiomimus! Are you ready for your trip to the storied landmass of Australasia?
You know what? Maybe I WILL take Utahraptor's extremely good advice (not pictured!)
Neat! Are there other slang words that have an origin in technical writing?
And yet, you must! ACTUALLY, "idiot" began life in ancient Greece - 
Um... but - uh, how can you afford that?  Bikes aren't free.
You want to hear music from before the invention of recorded sound! Nice.
But "proto" implies "before" - couldn't there be a better name for this?
I have other interests beyond sex!  For example I am interested in...
It's probably really terrifying and frustrating that nobody is willing to believe you.
You know who's never been drunk?  NOT EVER?  NOT EVEN ONCE??
LATER: T-REX RELEASES "PERSONAL BETH" SOFTWARE THAT AUTOMATICALLY ADDS BEST/BETH PUNS TO WEBSITES:
Um. OK. Let's go back to my place, and I'll make some tea.
What's this I hear about tea with a certain Dromiceiomimian friend of ours?!
Please?  Promise to meet me in a pub in 10 years, okay?
Hey, couple making out across the street!  She just jennifed you, dude!!
Shakespeare, I LOVE how you quote yourself instead of actually talking to me.
Judge: Hah! One thing's for certain: you sure can carry on a conversation!
His best friend is Clark Ent! They haven't done THAT before. "Clark Ent."
YOU DON'T KNOW ME BUT I LIKE YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS a web "card"
You did not let me finish.  I want to be a stomper!
Easy! I'll just remember to send a message back to this exact moment!
Okay Utahraptor, now it's centuries later and you ask me the same thing.
You can get dwarf ELEPHANTS.  Tiny little elephants with tiny little tusks!
Oh my goodness, Mr. Tusks!  Are you the MAYOR of Tiny Towne?
So wait - can an act then be considered immoral, but still ethical?
To the library! It's this way. I'm pointing to it with my fingers.
It was this guy.  He did it.  T-Rex.  This guy.
I don't think you should use the word "retarded" like that, Michael Chabon.
But what's the narrative? You can't just have two people chasing each other.
Movie Poster Text: THE GUY WHO STILL KEPT TAKING BITES OUT OF ANIMALS
Movie Poster Text: THE TWO BITEY GUYS DISCUSS EARLY APPROACHES TOWARDS LAISSEZ-FAIRE CAPITALISM
You know what I'm sayin', Utahraptor? You pickin' up what I'm throwin' down?
I'm - I'm personifying a little here but that's seriously what relativism does.
Kid: Mister, why is that man talking about when he was a kid?
I CAN'T BELIEVE I WAS STOOD UP AGAIN, TODAY, ON CINCO DE MAYO.
Remember my St. Patrick's Day date?  The woman who stood me up?
Or, knowing that no matter what, you're NEVER going to win the lottery!
I'm feeling it right now too, and I don't even watch nerd shows!!
Book Cover Text: he's a real catch and um, you should get married
Book Cover Text: MY LAST BOOK WAS MORE ABOUT FINANCIAL ADVICE THAN RELATIONSHIPS
All I've got to show for the past week is a kick-ass scar!
. . .The movie takes place on a planet where interrogation is banned.
And that's the amazing true story of how I invented my elixir, Dromiceiomimus.
SEE? SEE? This is why I keep my hopes and dreams to myself.
Under the couch! Of all the places for a lost baby to be...
It's a paradox!  Those are what happen when you travel through time.
Well, you can use "that's what she said!" when telling a story, too!
T-REX HAS YET TO FIND CHRISTMAS PRESENTS FOR ANYONE. AGAIN. COME ON, T-REX
But our friend Zach is a ghost, and he's not blind OR deaf!
T-Rex (thought bubble): Wow, I was DEFINITELY expecting to be married by now.
See, I thought it was too, but then I thought, maybe it's not?
I'm an American named Rick and I have two free tickets to America!
But maybe, building a time machine to an alternate universe: NOT SO HARD??
Any sufficiently-advance technology is indistinguishable from magic, T-Rex! Arthur C. Clarke said it.
I got a part in the new play down at the community centre!
Oh yeah, NOBODY is gonna want to buy the TERMINAL VELOCITY SKATEBOARD SIMULATOR.
I came up with a way to get my skateboard treadmill to work!
Man! I don't want to go through life as a Nazi pin guy!
Science will wither in the face of my sense of community and sharing!
Science will wither in the face of my sense of community and sharing!
The guys in charge of preventing that were watching the fires on TV!
No. He shoots a lot of guys while failing to stop it, though!
THAT'S REALLY NOT BAD FOR SOMETHING RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD
Is that what we do now?  Just shift songs into different formats?
Yes! You're right, this IS my chance! I forgot about it untill now!
"Why are we here?" "What is our purpose?" - that sort of thing!
Nope. He'd have to earn it! We'd do sports or something to see.
And let's say I'm knocked unconscious for, on average, 2 hours a year!
Why haven't you cured cancer yet, T-Rex? What is the friggin' hold up?
T-Rex's Lady Friend: This is the worst first date I've ever been on.
I never said that, Dromiceiomimus! You'd better not have quotation marks around that!!
These ideas aren't actually that bad!  I think tattoos should be ridiculous.
It's a little thing called a "METAPHOR", Will. Man! Study literary techniques much??
MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX HAS LEARNED ENGLISH ENTIRELY FROM KOREAN-ENGLISH PHRASEBOOKS:
And at other times, there's no record of him for years and years!
Imaginary Utahraptor: ha ha! [[both Utahraptor and T-Rex are being imagined by T-Rex]]
Imaginary Utahraptor: ha ha! [[both Utahraptor and T-Rex are being imagined by T-Rex]]
OR AN ENEMY COULD BE POISONING YOU TO DEATH, A LITTLE EACH DAY.
Hah! Wow, I - I don't even know what form that would take.
THE TIME FOR QUESTIONS IS OVER. NOW IS THE TIME FOR UNBRIDLED OPTIMISM
Hilarious!  It makes me want to buy a Sara-Lee branded cherry pie.
God, how come we live in a world where these awful diseases exist?
But you can't catch an inherited disease.  You're just egging on hypochondriacs!
The Devil: I GUESS I PARTICULARLY ENJOYED PROGRAMMING ALL THE MURDER SIMULATOR PARTS
This stops here! Admit you had nothing to do with GTAIV, The Devil!
"Genghis II punched Romeo IV on the nose." doesn't sound like good drama!
Did you at least like my comparison of life to a three-legged race?
Anyway!  With this in mind, I am going to become totally racist!!
Wow, you hate people who appreciate culture but who can't afford expensive artifacts?
You know, there are a lot of interesting parallels here with soap operas!
Are you trying to be... um, everything that I like in a woman?
Listen, if you want your wallet back, Dromiceiomimus left it inside your mailbox.
I don't want to be a police officer, and the reason is simple!
And yet, I still feel like I've discovered the ability to summon Beetlejuice!
Or more precisely, I've been sucking SURPRISINGLY HARD at writing a romance novel!
Oh my God!! I'd never actually pulled it off before! That was amazing!
So why are both these "explorations of the soul" found in horror stories?
No! I mean, it wasn't the reason! That was just an added bonus!
You know, Judaism has long had the "ketubah", which is basically a prenup!
In summary, life is too fragile and I describe that as "sucks ahoy"!
Uh NO, I didn't say I want my LIMBS to fall off. 
I don't understand why you keep lusting after these doomed careers, my friend!
Okay, fine, enjoy your hair-dressing. You just stepped on one of your customers.
Yeah! It took a whole lot of diet plans, and... and breakfast shakes?
You're describing the FICTIONAL nation of Poyais, T-Rex! That was a huge scam!
I wonder if today is a lovely day to go on a walk!
Ridiculous. What are you going to say? "WE NEED TO BREAK UP ;)"?
That is kinda hilarious if it's like this big weiner guy doing that!
Jennifer - Yes. Do you want a boyfriend who's only a little desperate?
Is this TRULY the day when everyone else wants to party as well?
That's because as of TODAY, I am the proud owner of a robot!
His name is Breadmatic 5000 and he's great. His specialty? Baking friggin' bread!
Today is the day I spend entirely in bed! Is this laziness? No!
It turns out there are some regions where my HyperBingo(tm) is played. Neat!
RARGH! I am getting the most out of destroying this tiny log cabin!
I think I'd rather NOT be around a guy who punches upon injury.
I think if you cured cancer or something, we'd still know your name!
Come on, T-Rex, that's just a stupid stereotype and lame soap opera trope!
T-REX PICK A WORK ANY WORK BUT MAKE SURE IT'S A NOUN OKAY
T-REX THERE IS BARELY 100 YEARS OF FILM SO THAT'S NOT SAYING MUCH

THURSDAY, JULY 7TH, 1994: 8:04 AM. T-REX IS RUNNING TO CATCH A BUS.
I've never seen a worse statue! You just turned around and switched feet!
Utahraptor (offscreen): See, T-Rex? THIS is what a statue of you looks like.
I'M SORRY NO, I AM ALSO A TALKING DINOSAUR AND NOT A SCIENTIST.
Think of how far we've come in just the past one hundred years!
I don't think I'm cut out to be a law-abiding member of society!!

So they're not allowing a disability to affect their job performance!  Nice.
T-REX IT WOULD BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR ME IF YOU WEREN'T SO SASSY

The best way to revenge yourself on an animal is to eat it.
Okay, you're coming with me and we're going to sneak onto a farm.
Upon closer inspection that was actually more a gift for me than Utahraptor
Later I asked her about Christmas and she told me Santa wasn't real
But Daffy's his name! Shouldn't we think of him when we hear it?
True.  Okay, but say you knew the BEST moment of your life!
Okay, but say it's passed, so it's all downhill from here on out.
So after this dramatic montage we're on the bridge, where the Captain is!
I thought, wow, if only they'd been wearing the shirts I just invented.
(It was inspired by an actual motorist I felt terrible about AND for!)
Aaaaand now I'm certain of it. I am speaking of the ninja teen.
Don't you mean, "This is why YOU shouldn't think about religion that hard"?
Come on!  Our culture COULD end up swinging towards rampant fleshotarianism instead.
Therefore, I will use deduction to determine my role and place in society.
Adults can see R-rated movies, but also have responsibility for their own well-being!
Get the hell out of here, Dromiceiomimus! The Contamination is right behind me!
"Standard" is the word you were going to impress us with?  "Standard".
I know!  And the best part:  there's NOTHING illegal about it!
So!  In summary and in conclusion, ladies and gentlemen of the jury:
No, wait.  "The Deluge".  "The Monsoon".  No, "The Happy Swamping"!
But I take it you don't count people with artificial organs as cyborgs.
Dromiceiomimus, I expected nothing less than the fun of a job well done!
That's funny, because taxes were due months ago, long before you contracted amnesia.
It's pretty much all in the title. Dude died tonight. In your arms!
I was just trying to figure out how this new "racist" thing worked!
I NOTICE THAT YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN TO THANK ME FOR MY FRIENDSHIP T-REX
WHEN YOU LIE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO MAKE IT SOUND BETTER THAN THE TRUTH
That's - that's a really good point, Utahraptor. Alright. No more joke names.
Oh daaaaaamn! I'm at the absolute peak of my fried chicken cycle, dudes!
Really? That's a little too after-school special for me and my past self.
TODAY IS SPECIAL BECAUSE NO WAY COULD T-REX EVER PUNCH OUT THE SUN

If you're ever trapped in the past you can recreate Celsius, no problem!
What do yours do? Dribble out salty water, but only when you're sad?
I don't see what the big deal is. We're having a nice chat.
But people just entering this panel have no idea what we're talking about.
Yeah, but we're not in a story, plus your AI only answers emails!
Okay I have no idea but the circumstances surrounding it are obviously terrible!!
One! Folks who snap up expired domain names and fill them with porn!
Folks who refuse to accept that one quality can easily be a dealbreaker!
Alright, so listen, my list got a bit crazy at the end there.
For example: every natural language includes the ideas of being "alive" and "dead"!
Eh? What do you think Dromiceiomimus? Is my flow TRULY the freshest possible??
...Okay, so, hey, that list's way less hilarious than I'd thought it'd be.
Um obviously I already know that!  We live in the same universe!!
Let us! Incidentally, my favourite Salt-N-Pepa song is "Let Us Talk About Sex".

ME NEITHER AS A FIND IT TO BE A REASONABLE FORM OF EXPRESSION
People are predicting the future all the time. All the time, you guys!
Well! Stomping on this woman is exciting but again - too familiar. 
AHA MY FRIEND BUT WHEN PRECISELY DID IT SWITCH FROM HEAP TO NON-HEAP
Probably for the fun of sport, T-Rex! The goal isn't actually the trophy.

Not anymore, Utahraptor!!  "I vow" is the new "I swear to God"!
Playing video games, eating food, hanging out with friends, and having ACTUAL SEX.
The story of how delicious this chowder IS is what won the award.

Raccoons and cephalopods: AND INSTEAD OF CAKE ON THE INSIDE, THERE'S REAL ORGANS!
It IS pretty unlikely that you'd be made to call us under duress!
And atoms are NATURE'S pixels! You just proved my case for me! Awesome!
I also made peace with the possibility that I might never have kids!
T-Rex, we're in the future! People have PHONES that can send emails now.
"Dear Professor, how much would it cost to buy the WHOLE DANG PLANET??"
Turns out greater minds than yours have thought about time travel already, huh?
Thank you! I am an extremely mature gentleman, and I'm flattered you noticed.
But if we don't want to kill ourselves, we can find religion, right?
Anyway, this is how come I'm so into vegetables that look like celebs.
If honeybabe made a mistake, I might say "Honeybabe, you made a mistake!"
Indeed, no-one can be expected to keep up with that sort of tromperie
"Also, every bit of current day poop came from there too; pretty gross."
HOW CAN I PROVE I'M ME? All my ID is inside the house!

Because if not then I doubt it would be a very good salad!
Not that I'd ever tell him that, of course.  I'm too self-absorbed!
Now I think I'll go stomp on a woman just because she's there!
Good luck representing that in a way that guys don't find inherently confusing!
Rrr! Just thinking about how bad that poem was is making me angry!
Want to go to the cinema, son? "The Mark of Zorro" is playing!
Do you recall a few days ago, when we had that hilarious conversation?
Many people assume the origin of this phrase has to do with testicles!
Well, what are YOU doing here, if we have nothing to talk about?
Aren't you describing an addiction to drugs? Something that makes you artificially happy?
I assured him that there are infinitely-many ways to say "I love you"!
Dromiceiomimus, did you know that Dinosaur Present Day, Featuring T-Rex, is coming up?
Ho ho ho, I get it.  No, "present" as in the gift!
Today I am excited!  Today I did not forget my dentist appointment!
Ha ha, no, this isn't a riddle. It's a real question I'm investigating!
Ha ha, no, this isn't a riddle. It's a real question I'm investigating!

What's with everyone asking me if I have cooties? Maybe YOU have cooties!
Ha ha, nice try! We all know that you're the one with cooties!
I have the basic idea! A whore is someone who collects coins, yes?
Good sir, my heart is aflutter!  I will do as you ask.
I'm disappointed, T-Rex! You're not living up to the possibilities of your decision!
Hey, Dromiceiomimus!  These people in this house, you know what they're saying?
I dreamed last night that I was sleeping in av ery tiny car.
COMIC IN WHICH THE DEAD COME BACK TO LIFE TO HARASS THE LIVING

And when people do compliment me on my classiness, I'll shake their hand!
T-Rex, I was hoping I'd run into you! Would you be my Valentine?
Do you recall a few days ago, when we had that hilarious conversation?
Dromiceiomimus, come over tonght!  I'm going to have an ICE CREAM NIGHT.
Yeah!  We'll all go out for ice cream!  It'll be fun!
I - I just would prefer it if you'd consider quitting the habit!
Oh yeah?  Prove it!  What am I going to do next?
I'm going to get lots of other people to write it for me!

It's extra nice, since today I have a full stomach! Life is good!
It is a popular pasttime on the first warm day of the year!
Ooh, do it on me! Pretend I got a new shirt or something!
The TRICK is to put all the vegetables into one easy-to-make, delicious dish!
Oh really? I think you might find you SPOKE too soon, my friend!
SORRY ABOUT THAT BUT I'VE GOT A GREAT JOKE FOR YOU TO TELL
I listened to a bit of it: one album was quite the "corker"!
Here there would be some ominous music - FOR WILL THE GIRL SURVIVE?
I almost wish I was bicurious, just so I could say, "Curiosity satisfied!"
You act as if the purpose of my life is to entertain others!

Yep! Things are pretty okay! So, um, any particular reason why we're talking?
Ha ha, nope! Maybe this will let US get a word in edgewise!
The point is, this card is to tell you that you are great.
Ah, yes indeed! Life is a neoclassical pastiche, and I, a great philosopher.
Hmm, but would it be better to be both young and in love.
In that case, I would advise them to meet women on the Internet.
Now all the pretty girls will want to dance with me for sure!
Just - you know, in general! I wasn't talking about anyone in particular.
What's with the sexist language, T-Rex?  You're all "great MEN, cultured MEN"!
Well, if I were a woman, I think I'd be a little offended
I was just talking about my favourite cross-cutting technique of all time. ALREADY.
Oh yeah? Well, I think that maybe your MOM has something to offer!
Oh I disagree! As you are clearly wr-ong, And I am quite right!
I think whoever is being dumped here is better off without this person!
It can also be difficult to convince people you've traveled from the future!
Of course there's always a danger when you go down the 'date-the-person-you-live-with' road.
Well, this has been quite the anagnorisis (a moment of recognition or discovery)!
Anyway, it affected these two women who I guess lived at my house!

But what if there's no food, and you're hellishly starving for an eternity?
What are you talking about? It's cool to get a good night's sleep!
Why would you ever want to be on the cover of a magazine?

T-Rex, you're talking about how sensitive you are while simultaneously stomping on things!
THE CHRONICLES OF MY DARK ELF CHARACTER ARE ASSUREDLY THE STUFF OF LEGEND
It's what comes after communism, I think. Basically, what's the deal with it?
Dude! You're coming close to questioning the very IDEA of an enemies list!
It's a very tricky question, and one that many people feel strongly about!
It's a very tricky question, and one that many people feel strongly about!
Sounds like you've got a lot of chores to take care of today!
I'M the one who's putting on weight.  I'm getting old and chubby!
So! Has anyone here ever tried setting goals, and then achieving those goals?
Yes, just some chips and a drink. I didn't need either of them!
ATTEMPTS TO RECORD THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE FROM ALL POSSIBLE ANGLES AT ONCE FAIL:

Man, you can't really believe in a "language organ" that makes communication innate.
Don't worry - they're the least significant bit of my speech. Oh ho!
Here is a list of things to do while waiting in an airport!
So if you were throwing a party, would you invite a taxi driver?
Looks like I'm still the world authority on myself, everyone!  Go ahead!
You must admit that it makes the whole debate a lot more interesting.
I said, I guess some people just aren't cut out for having pets!

Yes, that will be my new goal! I will become the perfect friend!
Hey T-Rex, do you want a hand?  We could do it together!
I have been compiling a list that I think might be of value!
I'm not thinking of any in particular, actually!  Just the general case.
Broken timeflows are crazy! I'm sorry! Maybe we can fix it with wishes?
So does life, probably!  It wouldn't matter because we'd all be dead!
There's so much wrong with your theory, I don't know where to start.
But you do admit you don't have control over the entire universe, right?
I fear this plan of absolute honesty is doomed to failure, my friend!
They were FINE. It's a slide! People are meant to fall down it!
Here's a tip: SOME babies need to learn to cry a little less!
But - copyright laws as applied to software IS really interesting! Come on!
T-REX DECIDES TO SOLVE ALL HIS PROBLEMS BY FOUNDING HIS OWN UTOPIAN COMMUNITY:
These bugs aren't made out of what I think they are, are they?
That's right, ladies!  I am going to be a dude with direction!
The second-most-often used is "was", then "be" and "are" and "have" and "had".
that Utahraptor and his ilk. I don't care what he thinks we did!
Damn, guy, you shoulda realized when the Utahraptor was as big as you!
So you assumed! But, think back! Did you ever see me wearing pants?
Is that what they do in hell? Play video games all the time?
Hey, who wants to come with me to sneak around in abandoned buildings?
I notice you are leaving! Could my conversational stylings be partially to blame??
For example: "Confucius say... man who run in front of car get tired!"
Much as a watch implies a watchmaker, so does our universe imply divinity!
You can't say that!  Class is important!  Class is really important.
Because a language is never passed down, just an approximation of a language.
Yeah, I guess I was!  Hah hah! That WOULD be pretty crazy.
I can and I will!  This is all in good fun, right?
I'll just be late, that's all! Late with my PILLOWCASE FULL OF CANDY.
"In conclusion: it's untenable"? YOU MUST BE A LOT OF FUN AT PARTIES!
Well! I certainly hope I don't get prematurely invited to any PARTIES today!
You know what's better than school? Not being in school but still learning!
For example, if you said "showers" and I said "s/sh/fl/", you'd get "flowers"!
(left elbow down, right elbow up) The crazy Utahraptor thinks I have OCD.
Ryan: What was that awful music? Did you just eat a foley engineer?
Then I am going to be requesting a refund for that correspondence course!
Awwww, T-Rex! Can't you just use a human trap instead of killing him?
CHICKS ARE NOT AS MULTIFACETED AS A TRUE PEN-AND-PAPER ROLY PLAYING GAME T-REX
Utahraptor's started his own charity dedicated towards reanimating his body when he dies.
It rules!  All these kids handed in essays with massive spelling mistakes!
So then, today is a good day for learning to play the piano!
I guess if they were a crazy racist, that would probably do it!
Dromiceiomimus! You owe me ten sub sandwiches, and I'm calling in the debt.
That is such a made-up bet! I owe you zero cases of pop.
Anyway man, who says you're in charge of when things become "old hat"?
Why did I say that?? I AM EVEN MORE POOCHED THAN EVER BEFORE.
For instance: the word "awful" (really bad) and the word "offal" (burchered entrails)!
That's it - I'll sell naked pictures of myself online!  FOR PROFITS!
But "begging the question" is mostly used today to mean "raising the question"!
Oh goodness, I am so thirsty. My thirst is - exquisite. Sublime. Immaculate.
Please! I am trying to consider the nature of thirst. It's - stern?
T-Rex, enough! Is this story supposed to have a case of the sucks?
Some people believe that you can come back as plants! They're BARELY alive.
Dromiceiomimus! There's no time for talking about FEELINGS now. We're doing an experiment!
Check it!  Eating food in bed is like "#8212; a crappy duck?
Stop! I just realized humans and dinosaurs never existed at the same time!
Hah hah!  That is definitely the worst poem I've heard all day.
My friend, you have to be WACKY to go on a wacky adventure
So what's the symbolism there? Is it called "The Life Machine" or something?
So yeah! That's why I can never see myself using the word "twincest".
I have written a new story, called "Make Way, Here Comes Tiny Chef!"
Worse, what if they bury me in an UNCOOL part of the graveyard?
Not really, since there's nothing buried there yet!  It is pure FORESHADOWING.
I somehow doubt that real bisexuals prefix all their words with "bi", T-Rex!
But what is a universe compared to the collective arts of countless civilizations?
Here comes that utahraptor, again.  No doubt to debunk my pseudo-philosophical ideals.
Dromiciomimus: Well - I mean, you'd do the same thing for us, T-Rex.
Today is a good day I think for cleaning up my house. Goodness!
Man, Superman could kill Batman before Bats even knew the fight had started!
Whoah, T-Rex! What the heck are you doing, making jokes about sexual predators?
Oh, hellow, Dromiceiomimus! I hear you had a. . . SUPER day today?
Oh man! Let's go to the beach and hang out in flattering swimsuits!
One time I got a little lost while driving in a new town.
"Live every day like it's your last."  How hard could it be?
No, those are sex rolls. Gender rolls are shaped like housewives and firemen!
Is it when people do a lot of "speed" and then run around?
I guess you'd know about that, huh? Cause of the whole "religion" thing?
So - at the end of the day, what does this prove, T-Rex?
Wow, you've entirely ripped off Hobbes' Leviathan, in which he says EXACTLY THIS.
Being tall in a world designed for average people can be sucky sometimes!
("Norms" is what I call normal people, AND sets of guys named "Norm".)
What chick? Where are all the chicks? We're two dudes and we're alone!
What about people who came from eggs? Like, for example, EVERY DINOSAUR EVER.
What happens is we all receive gold medals for having such nice bikes!
GOD! ARE THERE YET ANY LAWS AGAINST MOTHERS BEING EXTREME, DO YOU KNOW?
Okay. I guess that's what I'm going to spend my life doing today.
I think, as a people, we have kind of dropped the ball! 
A belief is justified only if there is sufficient evidence to support it!
If you could do anything to make a living, what would it be?
That's great -  BUT WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS??
Dromiceiomimus, what are YOU doing here? I thought it was Just The Guys!
I also vacuum as if nobody's going to get their carpets any cleaner!
Hey, your friend back there looks just like Edgar Allan Poe! That's crazy!
Ultimate Friend, close your eyes and tell me what colour my eyes are!
UTAHRAPTOR ASKS DROMICEIOMIMUS TO HELP HIM OUT BUT FAILS TO BRIEF HER PROPERLY:
All you're doing is talking about punch! Why not just go get some?
It's very nice to meet you, Jimbo Wales, founder and president of Wikipedia!
*sigh*... I think it would be a great day to do some stomping...
A "loaded question" is when you ask a question that presupposes something unproven!
For instance, Dromiceiomimus, I could ask, "Hey, Dromiceiomimus! Are you still punching children?"
I've allowed my love of gravy to distract from my prescriptivist linguistic crusade!
Who spent their Tuesday night doing the BEST THING POSSIBLE?? The answer: me!
The Devil: MMM GREETINGS T-REX I HAVE A QUERY OF A PERSONAL NATURE
MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX WATCHES THIS OTHER T-REX'S LIFE ON TV:
LUCKILY, T-REX DISCOVERS A SURE-FIRE WAY TO TURN $295.95 INTO QUICK MARITAL BLISS!
Well - you tried! You don't have to be a walking revelation factory.
Date: You are so charming, T-Rex! And I LOVE learning about waste reclamation!
YOU WERE JUST PREPARING FOR YOUR BELLY SWELLING WITH MY SO DELICIOUS PASTRIES
Man, I'm a butterfly saddled with crip
