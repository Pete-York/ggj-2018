T-REX IS SUDDENLY REMINDED OF SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT TO WORRY ABOUT:
I SUSPECT THE GAME WAS SIMPLY NOT AVAILABLE IN MY AREA
Some say dedicating your life to helping others is the key.
Hee hee!  I am the best friend to have ever!
Man, I'm amazing! I'm a machine that turns FOOD into IDEAS!
Today is a good day I think for talking about ex-girlfriends!
Well, actually, the thing you and I have is sort of-
So what about relationships that can't be summarized into one word?
Day! Me say day me say day me say dayyyyyy o!
We can only imagine what it must have been like -
Man, we're dinosaurs! What the heck are we doing in airports?
Today is a good day I think to talk about pretension!
One person's pretension can easily be another's well-argued piece of literature.
Nothing!  Oh man, I wouldn't even know where to start!
Oh man, let's talk about zombies! They're the coolest by far!
I guess some people just aren't cut out for having pets!
I'm not really sure that I could invent anything useful, though!
What? Dude it's been so long since I've seen the ocean.
The idea of birds forgetting how to fly? Yeah, that's sad!
Heck, I probably wasn't going to kiss anyone this month ANYWAY.
Hey, how do you know that that's what Dante was thinking?
DROMICEIOMIMUS!  ARE YOU UPSET WITH ME AND IF SO WHY?
Did you hear? The Utahraptor totally "wigged out" on me yesterday!
Today is a good day I think to talk about phlogiston!
Our current understanding will have to be UPDATED, pending my success!
Well, it is good that you want to find out more!
You're right: there's no way that could lead to anything good.
Has this technique ever solved ANY of your problems, T-Rex? 
Dude, I simply employed lots of ingenuity and cleverness! SO much.
That's not an explanation! That's not even close to an explanation!
Today is a good day I think to talk about HINDUISM.
Well - after being small and irresponsibly eating a lot, yeah.
You're questioning the basis of science by postulating a non-deterministic universe.
That makes me sound pretty messed up, but yeah! I guess!
We could debate it, but that might make me very sad.
Aww, I'm sorry, T-Rex! But how do you know it's discrimination?
I'm wearing underpants on my head AND passing my driver's test!
Off-Panel: Yes, but it's not rational to assume that's the case.
Man, I remember that thermos! What happened when you opened it?
DONATED MONEY TO AN ORGANIZATION TO HELP BUILD NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE OVERSEAS:
You know what's dumb?  Not believing my incredibly plausible story!
MEANWHILE, SOMEONE ELSE HAS GONE BACK IN TIME TO KILL T-REX!
I SIMPLY WISH TO ASCERTAIN YOUR OPINION ON CLASSIC GAME EMULATION
D-Do you want to do it at your place or mine?
How can you talk about vitamins when I'm having your baby?
THINGS THAT T-REX HAS GOTTEN FOR FREE IN THE MAIL COMICS
They were so vile.  I literally could not understand it.
'Cause it's a beanie cap with a glow-in-the-dark propeller on top?
NOTHING! EVERYONE HAS A GREAT TIME AND TAKES SOME AMAZING PICTURES:
I would have words with the people in charge of aphorisms!
Does language alter the way we think?  Sources say: perhaps!
Off-panel (whisper): t-rex, i am a talking bottle of vanilla extract
Whoah, so instead of attacking the position, we attack the person?
So wait, I missed it - what's your new book about?
Dude, you know what I say?  I say, "forget class!".
Man, anyway!  I'll come up with my own incredible challenge.
It's not just hard: in fact, it may well be impossible!
Could it be you have a CRUSH on flappers, my friend?
Hey, I've got a great idea, T-Rex: let's get tattoos together!
Now don't go around telling that secret to anyone else, okay?
This is because I'm violating the understood limits of our friendship!
That's so unlikely. It's such a weird thing to worry about.
You mean I can go to Uganda and they'll understand me?
Do they need Powerful word-parsing in Uganda? Try PERL's "Regular Expressions"!
T-Rex, you are confusing yourself with a Bill Murray character again.
I INVITE YOU ALL TO PLAY RPGS WITH ME TONIGHT T-REX
Are you going to try mind-altering drugs because of peer pressure?
So, tiny bug on my nose, how was your day today?
It's a world where everyone knows how they're going to die!
For such a skilled dinosaur as myself, it should be simple!
I'm going to do mind-altering drugs as a science experiment, Dromiceiomimus!
This is actually a pretty tricky question I've considered myself, T-Rex!
Today is a good day I think to talk about robots!
MY position is that babies should be named after old girlfriends!
Are you really into all your ex-girlfriends that much?  
You must not have heard what my main character's name is!
Hey, remember when years ago, you wanted to see the future?
I was speaking in hilariously inappropriate homophones! IT WAS EXTREMELY HILARIOUS.
WHAT ONE CHANGE WOULD YOU MAKE TO YOURSELF IF YOU COULD
I've seen you look intrigued before, T-Rex, I'm sure of it!
YEAH ANYWAY NOW I'M DOWN A TRILLION LIFETIMES OF FRIED CHICKEN
While clearly extreme, can such activities truly be considered capital-A Adventure?
I wish for worldwide peace and love with no negative consequences!
Oh man, ouch! Shot down! Looks like no wishes for you!
Keep on swimmin', ladies, because I love you both super equally!
I plan on developing SEVERAL crazy theories about the postal service.
IN MY OPINION THEY ARE A COMPELLING FORM OF ELECTRONIC ENTERTAINMENT
I have not.  Okay?!  Let's talk about something else!
I WAS QUITE CLOSE TO REVEALING RARE AND POWERFUL CHEAT CODES
I have a friendship crush on all my friends. They're great!
BARELY. So barely! I've seriously never been impressed with a plant.
Don't get me started about sunflowers. God! Their salty, boring seeds!
And, I SUPPOSE, plants that cure diseases are pretty alright too.
Hey T-Rex! I've also got an emotional problem that needs solving.
I really wish I'd invented fire extinguishers or something.  Man!
I think most dogs can do that with some accuracy, T-Rex.
You're good at making friends though, T-Rex!  You're not shy!
I regret spilling a glass of ginger ale on an architect!
You sure know a lot about the history of hysteria, T-Rex!
I saw the greatest TV show last night.  It ruled!
I would like to extrapolate this up to the societal level!
T-REX I JUST STOLE THE KILOGRAM IT IS MY GREATEST HEIST
Can you just ASK someone to fall in love with you?
It's about a tiny chef who makes tiny food for everyone!
People might equate a weaksauce funeral with a correspondingly weaksauce dude!
Like I'm surprised at how sucky a time traveler I am?
Hah hah, SWEET.  Sorry it's not working out, bidisillusioned dude!!
For your information, I have read SEVERAL websites on the subject.
I mean - I mean my friend has seen the pictures.
It is these positive benefits of having friends that concern me!
HEY T-REX HOW COME YOU ALWAYS SLEEP ON YOUR LEFT SIDE
Oh! Um... throw... women, off the trail of my - feelings?
Would you really have been happy if the car got stolen?
Dromiceiomimus, do you have any EMBARRASSING STORIES you feel like sharing?
So you're not going to do either of those things today?
Well, I guess that WOULD be kind of neat to see!
Maybe you'd all like to come and have some dinner first?
They're still in the ground, so they last for years! Tada!
HEY T-REX CAN YOU SUMMARIZE THAT IN ONE SENTENCE FOR ME
TALKING ABOUT LOVE: NOT THE SAME AS ACTUALLY BEING IN LOVE
Utahraptor [[outside the panel]]: It has always been my special power!
HEY AN AUDIENCE MEMBER HAS SOME OPINIONS HE'D LIKE TO SHARE
Wait, I'm a brilliant psychologist! ALL COMFORT COMES FROM THE WOMB!
T-Rex Besides being amniotic fluidy, YES, my kisses are memorably yolky.
AFTER THIS, WILL ANYONE EVER KISS T-REX AGAIN? LETS FIND OUT:
Utahraptor, you crazy dude! What are you doing in
