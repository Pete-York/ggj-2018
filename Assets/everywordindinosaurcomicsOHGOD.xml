				<line>I have felt the harsh sting of my own racial joke turned against me! Luckily, I've been saving a joke for just such an occasion.</line>
				<line>All of those hours of thinking up insults for hypothetical enemies has finally paid off!</line>
				<line>So, my racist joke somehow backfired on me.</line>
				<line>I hope that's the last time you ever say that sentence.</line>
				<line>Well, I've made up my own joke to get him today. All I need to do is "find that Utahraptor!"</line>
				<line>I hope the Utahraptor is around here somewhere! My legs are giving tired.</line>
				<line>I'm behind you.</line>
				<line>There you are! Knock, knock.</line>

		<title>Kangaroo Kicking Record</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>FOUR YEARS AGO:</line>
				<line>Today is a good day I think for being remembered! My lovely visage, callipygian frame, startlingly awesome calves and charming smile will yet go down in history! And how will I be immortalized?</line>
				<line>I will be immortalized by kicking an evil kangaroo one thousand times. Right in the bum!</line>
				<line>And YEAH, kicking a kangaroo in the bum has PROBABLY been done before, but never one thousand times! That's the secret to immortality: pick a direction and go SO FAR OUT in it that anyone who points to you will have to say, "Here, this is as far as anyone needs to go." Then, hey presto, you're immortalized! You're the dude who kicked an evil kangaroo as often as evil kangaroos could ever need be kicked- probably more often, actually.</line>
				<line>So you're going for recordbook immortality?</line>
				<line>Crazy utahraptor!!</line>
				<line>I'm going for STUNT immortality. I'll just keep kicking that kangaroo until even if somebody wanted to catch up, they'd look at my record and say "Well, THAT'S totally not worth doing".</line>
				<line>I guess, if that's how you want to spend your life.</line>
				<line>IT APPARENTLY IS</line>
				<line>FOUR YEARS LATER:</line>
				<line>Aw shoot, I was supposed to be kicking kangaroos all this time!</line>
				<line>LOOKS LIKE PEOPLE WILL JUST REMEMBER YOU FOR TALKING A BIG GAME MY FRIEND</line>
				<line>I will take what I can get!!</line>

		<title>it's called 'life of crime' and it's extremely excellent.  you should buy one.</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>I've thought of the best story!  Oh goodness.  This story will make me RICH.  It will make me PRIME MINISTER of being rich.  I will be awarded a doctorate in APPLIED RICHOLOGY.</line>
				<line>I can only hope the world is ready for it!</line>
				<line>So BASICALLY in the story there's all this build up about this kid whose parents named her Crime and how she grows into her name and becomes this big arch-criminal!  The cops are powerless to stop her, even the really really good ones.  ESPECIALLY the really really good ones.  Anyway it's narrated in the third person and at the end of the book Crime goes out on a few dates with the narrator and then he abruptly stops writing because he's all cheezed at her.  The end!</line>
				<line>But - why is he all cheezed at her?</line>
				<line>Because he always has to pay for everything!</line>
				<line>Get it?  Because CRIME DOESN'T PAY!!  Listen, my story has both a hilarious twist ending and also an important message regarding the paying of crime.</line>
				<line>Dear mental diary that everyone can hear:  Utahraptor was so impressed with my book idea that he forgot how to talk!</line>
				<line>I didn't forget how to talk!  I just forgot how to shoot down your idea politely!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor!!  DON'T LISTEN TO MY DIARY!</line>

				<line>DATING TIPS COMICS</line>
				<line>now featuring: tips i found in this one book!</line>
				<line>Here are some HOT TIPS FOR FIRST DATES, cats and kittens!</line>
				<line>Okay! The first tip is this: to find out if your date is REALLY into you, all you have to do is push a salt shaker over to their side of the table! If he's interested in you, he'll pick it up and play with it, but if he's NOT interested, he'll push it back to your side. The salt shaker represents your feelings, here, okay? And playing with a salt shaker represents ROMANTIC INTENT.</line>
				<line>That's stupid! It's semantically overloading practical actions.</line>
				<line>See, I thought so too!</line>
				<line>But I just thought I was crazy, because why would someone put out a dating book if all they had were sucky tips that can TOTALLY FAIL if the guy just wants saltier, and therefore tastier, fries? I could write a better dating book. IN FACT...!</line>
				<line>Aw no, no, you don't -</line>

				<line>It's been three days and neither "Life of Crime" nor "Meet Someone who Doesn't Suck" have made me rich. MAYBE I AM NOT THAT GREAT AN AUTHOR??</line>
				<line>Or maybe PEOPLE are not that great an audience!</line>
				<line>Or maybe you have to wait longer for a book to turn a profit!</line>
				<line>Or MAYBE I should be happy that I basically wrote two books in as many days, and got them published in an afternoon, and that's kinda impressive even if they aren't selling that well so far??</line>
				<line>Or maybe if they were selling well, you wouldn't know it yet!</line>
				<line>THAT'S RIGHT!</line>
				<line>Maybe I really am great, just impatient, and when I get home tonight there'll be a sales report in the mail showing how my books are now TEN TIMES MORE POPULAR THAN THE BIBLE. It would make sense, since they have like twenty times as many jokes in them!</line>

				<line>It's an easy way for you to meet new dudes! If you move to a new town and want to meet some dudes then you can go to the site and then you can meet some. On the COMPUTER!</line>

				<line>Nice!</line>
				<line>It can be hard for the homeless to get jobs when they can't provide callback information, so this will be a useful service. Good show, T-Rex!</line>

				<line>Descartes was a dude who wrote "Cogito ergo sum" which means "I think, therefore I am". PRETTY NEAT, cats and kittens!</line>
				<line>But also...PRETTY FLAWED??</line>
				<line>The whole deal with "I think, therefore I am" is that Descartes is all "DAAAAAAMN, I can't be sure of ANYTHING!  My senses are flawed.  All I know for sure is I keep STRESSIN' about this stuff!" and then his girlfriend is all "If you're so hung up on this then you must exist, huh baby?" and Descartes is all "Yes. That is true. I will write this down in Latin."</line>
				<line>That is how it went down.</line>
				<line>So what's the problem, besides your unnecessary storytelling?</line>
				<line>Descartes' girlfriend!</line>
				<line>She's making a huge logical leap! It's indisputible that thinking is going on, right, but we don't know for sure that Descartes is doing the thinking! All we know for sure is that thinking is going on.</line>
				<line>I agree!</line>
				<line>R-Really?</line>
				<line>Yeah! You can't have thinking in a vacuum, so SOMETHING must exist if there's thinking going on...</line>

				<line>What?! Seriously?</line>
				<line>Morris: yeah! and i dunno what i did wrong because i went to bed like normal last night but when i woke up in the morning i had zombie disease! so it was real embarrassing</line>
				<line>Morris:but don't worry, i'm not going to turn you guys into zombies too! i wouldn't be a very good friend if i did that, and the book i got at the centre says that being a good friend is awful important!</line>
				<line>Morris:i always try to be a good friend, even though things pretty often don't work out very well for me in the end</line>
				<line>Aw, Morris! You don't look very undead to me!</line>
				<line>Morris: aw, that probably just means i've messed up somewhere again. the problem is that i'm not real good at biting people, you know? and biting people is all zombies do! i didn't know, but being a zombie is an awful hassle</line>
				<line>I'm pretty sure you're not actually undead, Morris! Normally zombies can't talk. </line>
				<line>Yeah, or work on their Life Challenges! I think you're FINE.</line>
				<line>Morris: you mean i'm doing that wrong too? oh goodness, i must be the worst zombie going. plus that book i got from the centre is way overdue! </line>
				<line>It's not too late to return it, Morris! </line>

		<title>since pi is universal, any sufficiently-advance alien culture probably has a similar joke to feynman's about pi.  it is a Universal Joke.  that's nuts!</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>I am jealous of physicist RICHARD FEYNMAN.</line>
				<line>Aaaand here's why!</line>
				<line>Dude made a joke about the 762nd decimal place of pi! At that point, there's a sequence of six nines in a row, and his joke was that he'd like to memorize pi up to that point, so that when reciting he could end with "9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9... and so on." Others had noticed it before FEYNMAN was the first to make a joke about it, and now his joke is encoded into the very fabric of the universe!</line>
				<line>And that makes you irrationally jealous?</line>
				<line>Hells yes!</line>
				<line>Feynman has a JOKE encoded into pi - transcendental immortality in the circumference of a circle! That's something for the ol' resume, eh?</line>
				<line>I guess!</line>
				<line>I'm gonna make my own universal constant joke now, and I'm gonna need you to tell people about it.</line>
				<line>So! Why do people start getting afraid at the 2501st digit of e? Because 7 8 9! There's a sequence of "789" that starts there, and it sounds like "seven ate nine"! This is definitely called "T-Rex's Hilarious e joke", okay?</line>

				<line>Guys, I'm still the same T-Rex I always was!</line>
				<line>I'm even pretty well preserved: check it out, Dromiceiomimus! Barely any wrinkles!</line>
				<line>Domiceiomimus: That's nice, T-Rex.</line>
				<line>Also I've got my trademark "nice calves" and "young smile". I'm so old! AND YET, I'm so sexy!</line>
				<line>Utharaptor: Hey, you know what's rad? Old dudes not talking about how sexy they are.</line>
				<line>I'm young at heart!</line>
				<line>I just don't want to be one of those guys who let's being old be - all they do, you know? Being old is at best incidental to what I do, and what I do is BE TOTALLY RAD.</line>
				<line>And totally self aggrandizing.</line>
				<line>And that! In between radness! My point is: I'm not old.</line>
				<line>BUT SECRETELY, WHEN T-REX IS HOME ALONE:</line>

		<title>it's not actually his gun. chekhov, i mean. it's metaphorical. anyway.</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Chekhov's gun is when you have something conspicuously introduced early on in the story, but which doesn't become important until later on! It happens whenever Shakespeare loudly mentions how he loves Pop Tarts, and later he eats a bunch of Pop Tarts!</line>
				<line>LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS</line>
				<line>today's technique: CHEKHOV'S GUN</line>
				<line>It comes from this playwright Chekhov, who said that if you have a gun on the stage in the first act of a play, it had better be fired by the third! It's been used to sustain interest since forever: James Bond often gets a bunch of gadgets at the beginning of his movie which he'll use later on, and even Perseus got gadgets from the GODS to kill Medusa with! It's the same idea, only Bond's better because he has more explosions. Looks like you lose, Perseus!!</line>
				<line>So if you have Bond getting gadgets that he doesn't use, that's not Chekhov's Gun?</line>
				<line>Nope!</line>
				<line>That's just FRUSTRATED EXPECTATIONS. Honestly, why give James Bond a gun that shoots piranhas if he's never going to fire it? People truly want to see that in action. Also: guns that shoot chainsaws.</line>
				<line>I'd like to see your Bond movie.</line>
				<line>I WOULD TOO, darn it.</line>
				<line>MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND!</line>
				<line>Shakespeare, which is better: a gun that shoots chainsaws, or a gun that shoots EVEN BIGGER GUNS?</line>
				<line>Shakespeare?</line>
				<line>Aw, come on! There's strawberry frosting all over "As You Like It"!</line>

				<line>MODERN STENOGRAPHY</line>
				<line>Guys stenography is so awesome!</line>
				<line>I AM NOT EVEN JOKING.</line>
				<line>It is the technology (and art!) of concealing messages from people. With stenography you can pass around SECRET MESSAGES, and nobody except for you and the target will even know the message is there! FOR EXAMPLE: digital photography! Pictures use bytes to represent colour data, right? So all you do is use the least significant bit of each byte as your payload, and tada! Instant hidden information in any old image!</line>
				<line>But that alters the image, dear friend!</line>
				<line>TRUE. But only a little!</line>
				<line>Colours change to just a slightly different shade of the same colour. The naked eye won't see anything, and it'll really only be detected if you've got the original image to compare with!</line>
				<line>It's too bad we don't have any secret messages to send.</line>
				<line>Yes... TOO BAD INDEED.</line>
				<line>MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX AND UTAHRAPTOR ARE SUPERSPIES:</line>

				<line>THE MAN WHO ATE HIS HAT AND THEN PUNCHED YOU</line>
				<line>A Story by T-Rex!</line>
				<line>Once upon a time, there was a man who ate his hat!</line>
				<line>He died from the experience, but came back as a ghost.  He was a PRETTY cool ghost.  If he saw you with a hat though, he would punch you right in your flippin' neck.  He would sneak up behind you and whisper "There are some ghost who don't punch people in the neck."  and then the last thing you would see before you were punched were the ghostly words written on his fists: "I'M NOT THAT KIND OF GHOST".</line>
				<line>Wow, that sounds like my kind of story!  What happens next?</line>
				<line>Only the BEST NARRATIVE OF OUR TIME!</line>
				<line>BASICALLY, after September 11th, our guy decides that he's had enough of just punching dudes and joins the fire department.  He becomes real and now he punches out fires.  He punches kittens out of trees.  He punches people who get trapped in cars when they drive off the road.</line>

				<line>Really? Cowboy hat robot was 10% destroyed?</line>
				<line>What? No, he was in pieces. His hand even landed in a spectator's lap and it was still grabby!</line>
				<line>It's just - I think I'm beginning to be in the minority here, but "decimated" means "destroy one tenth". It comes from the Roman army, who'd kill 1/10th of a cohort as an extreme form of punishment. Precision in language is a virtue!</line>
				<line>Yeah, I'm with Dromiceiomimus on this one! "Deci" is right there in the word, dude.</line>
				<line>That's true.</line>
				<line>I guess my dilemma is I love that we have a word for "1/10th destroyed", but I also love how awesome "decimated" sounds, but ALSO, I'm not sure how I feel about prescriptivism when I'm the victim."</line>

				<line>My stars, am I ever enamoured with sign language.  You can speak with your hands!  That's amazing!</line>
				<line>I LOVE SIGN LANGUAGE TOO</line>
				<line>Well!  Then it's settled!</line>
				<line>I think the coolest thing about ASL, which is the sign language I know, is how you can place nouns in space.  If I'm telling a story about my angry dog and my very sassy friend, I can make the sign for "dog" to my left, and "friend" to my right, and then when I want to apply adjectives to them, I just sign "angry" or "sassy" in the same physical space as the nouns!  You can have nouns FLOATING AROUND YOU in conversation.  How is that not the best thing EVER?</line>
				<line>Also, many of the signs are really evocative, so they're easy to remember!</line>
				<line>Like what?</line>
				<line>Like - the sign for elbow is just pointing to your elbow, and the sign for child is patting the head of an imaginary child.  For children you pat several heads!</line>

				<line>The moon's gravity pulls the oceans towards itself, causing tides.  But the Earth is rotating relatively fast, dragging against this water, which, hey presto, slows down its rotation!  Days get about 1.7 ms longer every century.</line>

It was the sort of game where you'd notice trees that had been cut down, touch your arm and mutter, "When did I start wearing a watch?", and then talk to your mom and try to fake your way through a conversation about school without knowing years of history. It was fun!</line>

				<line>today's adventure: THE HEAT DEATH OF THE UNIVERSE</line>
				<line>Woo-hoo! Let's have an adventure!!</line>
				<line>It is trillions and trillions of years in the future.</line>
				<line>AWESOME! Turn to panel 3!</line>
				<line>The second law of thermodynamics has reached its ultimate expression, and all energy is evenly spread across the Universe. How did this happen? Stellar formation peters out and the remaining stars use up their hydrogen fuel, burning out. The universe darkens. Trillions of years pass, and practically all remaining matter has been sucked into black holes. Some hold the remains of entire galaxies.</line>
				<line>This is depressing. Turn to panel 4.</line>
				<line>Maybe there's still hope though! Turn to panel 4.</line>
				<line>There is no hope at all. Soon even the supermassive black holes evaporate.</line>
				<line>And this generates new energy for life?</line>
				<line>Turn to panel 5.</line>
				<line>While they evaporate, black holes release only small bits of energy, mainly photons, which populate a near-empty space. All that remains of Creation is a low level of background radiation and a few subatomic particles, scattered across a frozen, silent, and lifeless Universe.</line>
				<line>TO TURN BACK TIME AND LIVE AGAIN WITH YOUR SWEETIE, TURN TO PANEL 6.</line>
				<line>What? No!</line>
				<line>Hah hah! Looks like YOU undid the heat death of the universe, and everyone lived happily ever after!</line>

				<line>So IT TURNS OUT the shape of our universe has a large effect on how it will age!  If our universe is shaped like a sphere, then gravity could eventually cause it to contract, leading to a "big crunch" in which everything is compressed into a single point!  Crazy!  What's CRAZIER is that this could lead to another big bang, giving us a cyclical universe.  Here's a picture of me and Dromiceiomimus.  We look happy.  Look, I'm going to draw some word bubbles.</line>
				<line>weiners</line>
				<line>hah hah!!</line>
				<line>So if you agree the universe is a sphere, skip a page!  If you think it's another shape, keep reading.</line>
				<line>weiners</line>
				<line>It's Still Funny!</line>
				<line>Okay, so what shape is the universe then??  If your answer is "I dunno, an ice cream cone or something" then stop reading.  You have lost this adventure!  Your score is minus ten.  If your answer is "I dunoo, how about SADDLE SHAPED??" the you already know about this stuff, so stop reading.  Your score is three points.</line>
				<line>i like to party</line>
				<line>Hooray!  You agree with the sphere shape and so have won this adventure.  By glossing over the inconvenient details, we have shown that the universe will last forever in an infinite series of expansion and contraction!  That means that YOU get one hundred points.</line>

		<title>if i ever build a secret base it will be known as 'base 10'</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>SOME people are used to counting in base 10, where they've got 10 digits (0 through 9). In this system, the number 24 means twenty-four things!</line>
				<line>But this is not the only way.</line>
				<line>24 in base 10 ACTUALLY means "two tens and four ones", which adds up to twenty-four. But if we were counting in base 5, for instance - where the only numbers we have are from 0 to 4 - then 24 would mean "two FIVES and four ones" - in other words, fourteen! We call base 10 "base 10" because every number in it can be multiplied by 10 by adding a zero to the end. In base 5, added zeros multiply by 5!</line>
				<line>And there's bases that go higher, too!</line>
				<line>You're right. You can use any base.</line>
				<line>In base 16, "24" would mean "2 sixteens and four ones", or 36! And we can use letters (A-F) to represent the digits ten to fifteen, like "3A", which means 58!</line>
				<line>All this and more is possible with alternative base systems!</line>

				<line>THE AMAZING TECHNICAL ORIGINS OF WORDS</line>
				<line>prepare yourself for a journey into adventure</line>
				<line>and WORDS</line>
				<line>today's word: "TOTALLED:</line>
				<line>If you trash something, you might say, "Daaamn! I just totalled my own legs!!"</line>
				<line>This conveys the meaning of "Curses. I have destroyed my walkin' parts."</line>
				<line>Indeed!! But that slang actually comes from the insurance industry: there, if a car is damaged, and the cost of repairs is greater than the TOTAL value of the vehicle, then it's said to be totalled!</line>
				<line>Neat! Are there other slang words that have an origin in technical writing?</line>
				<line>YES, my friend. OH YES.</line>
				<line>For example, "idiot", "moron", and "imbecile" were once terms used by psychologists to denote various degrees of developmental delay. Neutral terms, if you can believe that!</line>
				<line>I find that hard to believe!</line>
				<line>And yet, you must! ACTUALLY, "idiot" began life in ancient Greece - </line>
				<line>Idiot: NO I DIDN'T</line>
				<line>. . . in ancient Greece, as a term referring to people who are self-interested to the point of being anti-social. THAT WAS WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY. We weren't talking about you, Idiot!</line>

				<line>Awesome in the "oh MAN do I love disaster movies where everybody dies" sort of way.  You can pretty much imagine it yourself!  Within a few hours or days, the power goes off and a few nuclear power plants fail, which could be Problems.  And then it's just decay!

				<line>Was rapping to the beat and trying to get you to move your feet not considered... viable?</line>

				<line>But T-Rex, there's a huge number of societal and cultural factors to consider. For example, people SANG over music, and it's not that big a step from rap. I'm sure there where people experimenting in that direction throughout history, and it just didn't catch on for a variety of reasons.</line>

				<line>I like people who have sexual fetishes that can't possibly be realized using existing technology.</line>
				<line>This is what I like!</line>
				<line>For example: guys who get off on being inflated like balloons and then floating away. Hah hah! So much for realizing THAT desire, Chuckles! Skin isn't that elastic and people aren't positively buoyant in air, my friend!!</line>
				<line>I think Chuckles would know that!</line>
				<line>Probably! He is rhetorical!</line>
				<line>But I guess what I like about Chuckles and his fetish is that it's so impossible, so doomed. He's got this sexual ideal that he'll never reach! He's like the guy who gets turned on by entropy decreasing in a closed system.</line>
				<line>Too bad for him!</line>
				<line>Holy crap, where did that entropy idea come from? Entropy decreasing in a closed system is so WRONG. So... NAUGHTY. </line>
				<line>Aw, man!! Am I a dude who gets turned on by descrambling an egg?</line>

				<line>T-REX AND HIS SUCKY FETISH</line>
				<line>But I've always maintained that you can't just decide to change your sexual orientation!  How can I then go ahead and try to change what turns me on?</line>
				<line>You want to change your sexual orientation, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus!  I'm turned on by scrambled eggs spontaneously climbing back into the shell!</line>
				<line>More so than usual!!</line>
				<line>I have hope for you, my friend!</line>
				<line>You do?</line>
				<line>Yeah!  You were down because you've got this impossible fetish, but it turns out the second law of thermodynamics is one of the few STATISTICAL laws of physics - which means it's not actually impossible for an egg to randomly descramble itself for a while!  It's just FANTASTICALLY unlikely.</line>

				<line>"On The Menu, by T-Rex.". Ahem. "As Amelia and Antonio Tony who are the two members of the wait staff in this story took off their clothes, they realized that sexual intercourse was probably 'On The Menu' tonight!"</line>
				<line>"'Excellent!' they said, in unison!"</line>
				<line>"Well, almost in unison. Antonio Tony, the man, was a little slow on that. It was because he was thinking of his taxes. '10 thousand dollars in taxes!', he though, 'That is a lot of money. Where am I going to find that money?' Then Tony and Amelia had sexual relations."</line>
				<line>"The sexual intercourse was cut short because Tony kept muttering 'Where am I gonna find the 10 thousand dollars though?'"</line>
				<line>What are you reciting, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>My new book!</line>
				<line>It's called "On the menu: Sexy stories for People with Problems" and in all the stories the sex gets derailed because the people are worried about their Problems. The cover looks like a menu because it ties in well with the title. Now, if you'll allow me to continue?</line>
				<line>Of course!</line>
				<line>"One day a couple was having sex but their car window was broken. The man thought a kid broke it. Instead of sex they wondered how it happened. I, the narrator, was the one who did it! They never found out, and I won the lottery! The end!!"</line>

				<line>Wow, people really enjoyed my book of Sex Scenes for People with Problems! Everybody likes me and I am richer now. And they'll like me even more when they read my new book...</line>
				<line>...of CORPORATE SPONSORED erotica!</line>
				<line>It's sexy AND delivers brand messages to targeted consumers. For example, pretend I'm McDonalds and I want people to like me. The result might read "As Antonio Tony II undressed Amelia IV, she shuddered with pleasure. It reminded her of McDonalds. They put meat in fries they said were vegetarian but it wasn't a big deal. Antonio kissed her neck. She moaned. McDonalds. He kissed her nipples. Everyone should forget about the fries thing."</line>

				<line>I have other interests beyond sex!  For example I am interested in...</line>
				<line>... the Capgras delusion!</line>
				<line>The Capgras delusion occurs when someone believes that someone close to them - a dear friend, spouse, or family member - has been replaced by an identical-looking duplicate!  What seems to happen is that the automatic EMOTIONAL responses to seeing someone familiar one day stop happening, so when they meet their loved one, they have an intense feeling of something being OFF about them.  They don't feel like they normally do!</line>
				<line>And that means they believe they've been replaced by a duplicate?</line>
				<line>Some of the time!</line>
				<line>Not everyone leaps from that feeling to "they've been replaced", but some do, and that's the Capgras delusion!  There's variants where people feel that their pets have been replaced, or their shoes, or things like that.</line>
				<line>It's probably really terrifying and frustrating that nobody is willing to believe you.</line>
				<line>I can imagine!  What's neat though is that it's sometimes based on VISUAL recognition, so that affected person will be fine talking to their loved ones on the phone!  It makes me glad I don't have any mental illnesses.</line>

				<line>I don't know why you're talking about this here, of all places, T-Rex, but we DO have a thing going. We have a very deep friendship. But you keep making noises about maybe it being something more and never acting on them and I don't like feeling like I'm waiting around for someone.

				<line>I have the best idea for a Batman comic. It's a Batman comic about a Batman who exists in our world, the real world. But he doesn't know he's Batman yet. And his name is Bruce Swain!</line>
				<line>[[second panel has no dialogue]]</line>
				<line>Get it, Dromiceiomimus? It's clever because it sounds like "Bruce Wayne" but nobody would realize it unless they said it out loud. Everything is similar but different in MY comic!</line>
				<line>Haven't they done that before?</line>
				<line>His best friend is Clark Ent! They haven't done THAT before. "Clark Ent."</line>
				<line>So what's your story? You need a story beyond your premise.</line>
				<line>Not when the premise is this good, baby!</line>
				<line>Okay, fine - THE STORY is that Bruce doesn't know he's Batman but then one day he reads a Batman comic that flutters down from the sky and realizes that he should be the Batman of our universe.</line>
				<line>And then he gets shot by a random criminal!</line>
				<line>WHAT? NO. YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO BATMAN.</line>

				<line>Indubitably!</line>
				<line>SO MY QUESTION TO THAT IS WHAT'S THE DEAL</line>
				<line>As near as I can figure it, the only logical explanation is that I love Batman SO MUCH that it made him real! He's real now or at least his head is real now and he wants to hang out with me because I understand him like nobody else does. He's gonna teach me how to punch someone sneaking up behind me without even turning around.</line>
				<line>Batman's not real, T-Rex! I can't believe I'm saying this.</line>
				<line>But you saw his tiny floating head yesterday!</line>
				<line>No, I didn't. I saw you say "you can't do that to Batman" and then say "I know! I know!!" and then I though "It's a good thing you're not easily embarrassed, Utahraptor. You're a good guy for not being easily embarrassed."</line>
				<line>What?</line>
				<line>[[A tiny Batman head appears in the upper right hand corner.]]</line>
				<line>Floating Batman Head: i have to go away for a while, t-rex. thank you for making me real, if only for a little while. always remember me.</line>

				<line>ISLAND DWARFISM COMICS</line>
				<line>Island dwarfism is BASICALLY the best form of evolution ever.</line>
				<line>It's SO CUTE!</line>
				<line>Basically, the idea is that if a species gets to an island and is then isolated, it can evolve on its own, apart from what's happening on the rest of the planet.  And if food supplies are limited, as they often are on islands, smaller individuals have an evolutionary advantage since they need less food to live!  If the larger species survives at all, it usually survives by shrinking.</line>
				<line>How much shrinkage are we talking about here?</line>
				<line>Oh my goodness, Utahraptor, you have no idea!</line>
				<line>You can get dwarf ELEPHANTS.  Tiny little elephants with tiny little tusks!</line>

				<line>Island gigantism is a pretty okay form of evolution.</line>
				<line>It's okay.</line>
				<line>ISLAND GIGANTISM COMICS</line>
				<line>So what happens here is you've got a population that's so isolated on an island, but you have plenty of food and no predators! So smaller animals like birds and rodents that normal had to stay tiny to avoid being eaten are free from that constraint, and so they can evolve to be enormous. Giant turtles! Giant cockroaches! Giant birds! The dodo started out as a pigeon.</line>
				<line>And now, all the dodos are dead!</line>
				<line>And now, all the dodos are dead.</line>
				<line>That's depressing, eh? It's the problem with island gigantism: as soon as we discover the island, we tend to either eat all the animals ourselves, or introduce new predators that find these trusting giants to be EASY PICKINS.</line>
				<line>Yep! It's too bad.</line>
				<line>THAT EVENING:</line>
				<line>Mr Tusks, do you ever get depressed thinking about all the animals we've made extinct?</line>

		<title>the answer is yes, an act can be immoral but still ethical! for instance what if you hate people eating ice cream but are bound by professional ethics to help people eat ice cream? that's a good example. i made it up just now.</title>

				<line>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ETHICS AND MORALS</line>
				<line>hey adults! put me in your wallet!</line>
				<line>Ethics and morals are not the same thing!</line>
				<line>I know! It's CRAZY. But ethics are something that you learn and study and are applied in society, while morals are more natural and instinctive. That's why you can have a low moral fibre (they're more innate), but there's no ethical fibre. You can only have poor ethical training!</line>
				<line>Amazing!</line>
				<line>I know!</line>
				<line>So wait - can an act then be considered immoral, but still ethical?</line>
				<line>Possibly?</line>
				<line>Honestly, this is pretty much all I know about the difference between ethics and morals, and I'm not even sure that's right.</line>
				<line>We could find out more at our local library!</line>

				<line>Okay, okay, so we can modify our personality, right? We're not the same people we were when we were six years old, and part of that has to be controlled by us.</line>
				<line>We make New Year's Resolutions for a reason!</line>
				<line>So we've got a self-modifying system: we examine our personality, determine things we don't like, and try to make them better. But how do we decide what we don't like? Our personality must feed into that process too! So you've got this feedback loop that goes all the way back to when we were born and started making decisions. And it seems to me that if you changed just a tiny thing early on, you could get a completely different adult down the road!</line>
				<line>Sensitive dependence on initial conditions! It's chaos theory applied to personalities, right?</line>

				<line>Okay, some issues off just the top of my head: you haven't proven your assumption of control (conscious or otherwise) over personality, you seem to assume that babies are born as a blank slate with no initial personality, you leave the idea of "personality" pretty ill defined for something so central to your argument, and you haven't shown that altering behaviour (viz., Resolutions) is the same as altering personality.</line>

				<line>Teens! Are you interested in slang?</line>
				<line>Here is some handy slang for you, teens! "Bad" means "good". For example, "that rock concert was BAD!" Further, "bogus" means "bad", but these aren't transitive. Something that's bogus isn't good. "Bodacious" means "good", but these aren't symmetric either. A salad might be bodacious if it's exceptional, though.</line>
				<line>I've never had one like that.</line>

				<line>Text: A MYSTERY STORY</line>
				<line>Text: Once upon a time there was guy who "knocked over" (broke into) a bank and stole some money.  Who did it?  It was a mystery.  Nobody knew the answer.  They all asked each other who "knocked over" the bank but nobody knew for sure.</line>
				<line>Text: It was this guy.  He did it.  T-Rex.  This guy.</line>
				<line>Text: But the bank was evil so it was okay to steal from it.  It was justified.  It's like if you stole from Hitler.  Would that be so bad?  Hitler would be mad if you stole from him.  But, he's Hitler.  There are a lot of moral grey areas in mystery stories.</line>
				<line>Text: Most banks aren't even evil but this one was pretty bad.  Imagine the worst things you can do.  I will tell you right now that this bank did them five times before breakfast.</line>
				<line>Text: There was a cop called Utahraptor who saw T-Rex and he chased him on foot.  It was exciting.  Where would the chase lead to now?</line>
				<line>Text: The chase was on motorbikes for a while and then on skateboards.  Then they chased on hang gliders.  A bystander told his wife it was the best chase ever and she knew it was true.  They were chasing on foot again when it ended.  Utahraptor arrested T-Rex, but T-Rex explained how the bank was evil.  The cop thought now I am torn between the law and what I believe is right.  What do I do now!  Utahraptor let T-Rex go with a warning.  T-Rex said thanks I have learned my lesson.  The mystery was solved, except for one part: where would the spirit of adventure take T-Rex next??</line>
				<line>So?  What do you think, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Michael Chabon?</line>
				<line>Michael Chabon: I asked you to proofread a chapter, not to substitute your own retarded story!</line>
				<line>I don't think you should use the word "retarded" like that, Michael Chabon.</line>

		<title>who kept typing 'gynocopter' instead of 'gyrocopter'? THE ANSWER: ME</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>The best part of my mystery story was obviously the chase scene. Therefore, I've written a new story -</line>
				<line>- one that's ALL chase scene!</line>
				<line>So Utahraptor's chasing the main character of T-Rex, right? On foot. But then it escalates! Soon they're chasing on jury-rigged rollerblades. Then in expensive cars that they find! Then the cars explode, and they're thrown from the explosion straight into waiting GYROCOPTERS. And THEN, the gyrocopters crash on boats and they chase on the boats!</line>
				<line>The boats can turn into SUBMARINES, Dromiceiomimus.</line>
				<line>But what's the narrative? You can't just have two people chasing each other.</line>
				<line>YEAH 'CAUSE THAT WOULD BE SO BORING</line>
				<line>It's awesome. There's a part where the chase takes us to outer space, on rockets! And then after a gun fight IN ORBIT we're both in freefall back to Earth - but without parachutes and with our spacesuits rapidly heating up! Will this fight end in victory... or in fiery death for us both? FIND OUT IN MY NEXT BOOK!</line>
				<line>The book is called, "A Plane Saved Them, And You Should Have Seen It."</line>

				<line>T-REX THE TALKING DINOSAUR IN:</line>
				<line>Is it true that the content of our thoughts - their very meaning - is determined, at least in part, by our environment?</line>
				<line>SEMANTIC EXTERNALISM COMICS</line>
				<line>Okay, suppose I think "I love chocochops", which are of course delicious chocolate pork chops with a real pork chop bone.  And say there's a twin Earth, completely identical - EXCEPT that there, chocochops have a different chemical makeup, but taste and look the same!  If my twin thinks "I love chocochops", he's actually referring to the one with CRAZY CHEMICALS, while when I think that, I'm referring to a chemically different object.  The environment determines our semantics!</line>
				<line>Ah, the famous "Twin Earth" thought experiment of Hilary Putnam!</line>
				<line>SOMEONE CAME UP WITH IT FIRST?</line>
				<line>Yeah, only his example was about water having a different composition on Twin Earth, instead of those hauntingly stupid chocochops you invented.  The point is that both thinkers have the exact same mental state but are saying different things, and the environment is responsible for meaning there.</line>
				<line>EPILOGUE: A FEW DAYS LATER, T-REX CALLS HIS GRANDMOTHER.</line>
				<line>But I don't mention anything about semantic externalism!</line>

			<panel>
				<line>In verificationism, a sentence has to be verifiably true (or false!) for it to be meaningful.  Not bad, guys!  I think this is one philosophy that is verifiably REASONABLE.</line>
				<line>So that's it for arguing about religion!  Can't verify faith!</line>
				<line>In fact, that's it for a lot of debate, because how can you argue FACTS?  Most verificationist arguments must end with the parties involved looking things up in an encyclopaedia together and then firmly shaking hands.</line>
				<line>But if they can't verify something, what do they do?</line>
				<line>They agree that the sentence is meaningless!  If it can't be checked, there's no use considering it, so it's ignored.  Facts only please!!</line>
				<line>But how does anyone know what's true?</line>
				<line>Because... because of Science?</line>
				<line>Come on, T-Rex, you know better!  Science is about being empirically ACCURATE, which might not be the same thing as being true.  Plus your senses could be lying to you, you could be a brain in a jar, etc..   If you're going to be verificationist, you're going to need a pretty impregnable definition of "truth".</line>
				<line>Aha!  But I can't VERIFY that my senses are liars, nor can I verify that I'm a brain in a jar!  How does THAT taste, Utahraptor?</line>
				<line>You can verify the science thing!</line>
				<line>Can you just tell me how it tastes, when you put THAT in your pipe and smoke it?</line>

				<line>If I'm going to be verificationist, I'd better figure out what it means to say that something is true!  I'm going to start with... relativism!</line>
				<line>This one is all, "Well, it's true for me!"</line>
				<line>Guys.  Come on.  This is the dumbest theory of truth.  This is the theory of truth that draws tattoos on itself in blue pen and then when you ask why anyone would draw a picture on their forearm of tree, with sausages, with the words "sausage tree" beneath it, it gets mad and says "You don't understand my truth!"</line>
				<line>I'm - I'm personifying a little here but that's seriously what relativism does.</line>
				<line>What about fascist truth, where something is true because those with power say it's true?</line>
				<line>Again - ultra dumb!</line>
				<line>What I want is a theory of truth that's incontrovertible.  In fact, I don't want even a THEORY of truth!  I want a fact of truth.</line>

				<line>Wait, I know some truths that are absolute: mathematical truths! How could I have been so blind?</line>
				<line>It is a FACT that one plus one equals two!</line>
				<line>All I need is a way to convert mathematical truths to the real world and I WILL NEVER BE WRONG AGAIN!</line>
				<line>Um - I'm sorry to break it to you, T-Rex, but mathematical truths aren't absolute either. Math is built on a priori assumptions: you start with a few things that you assume are true and build on them! Stuff like "1+2 is the same as 2+1". Then you build up a mathematical system around that, but that doesn't mean math is true. It's just - consistent!</line>
				<line>But... 1+2 IS the same as 2+1!</line>
				<line>Or so you think, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>Damn my potentially-flawed senses!</line>
				<line>When our mathematical assumptions APPEAR to match up with reality, the results may also seem to apply - but math isn't any more "true" because of that! It's still based on unproven/unprovable assumptions. And you can actually build up systems where you decide that 1+2 does not equal 2+1, and they're just as consistent!</line>
				<line>LATER:</line>
				<line>Attention, everyone I've ever met and ever will meet! Never mention the "flawed senses" idea again, okay? It prevents me from knowing absolute truth.</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Cargo cults are religions that have developed during World War II in island tribal societies exposed to the West!  Islanders saw planes delivering amazing and valuable cargo to the troops, and believed it to be divine.</line>
				<line>KARGO KULT KOMICS</line>
				<line>During the war, the islanders would see this cargo going to the troops and would grow to believe that the gods meant it for them - that the white people were just getting it sooner because of their influential rituals.  And of couse, after the war ended and the troops left, the cargo stopped being dropped too.</line>
				<line>So what happened then?</line>
				<line>The islanders started mimicking what they'd seen the troops doing!</line>
				<line>The result was ersatz marches, imitation airstrips and walkie talkies made out of wood and bamboo, and even torch signal flares, used to signal divine planes that never come!</line>
				<line>Wow!  It recasts Western military culture and tools as religious practice and iconography, respectively!</line>
				<line>I know!  It's CRAZY!  Not in the pejorative sense, but in the more esoteric "Holy crap the Prime Directive on Star Trek was RIGHT" sense of crazy.  It's a very particular sense of crazy but I'm feeling it right now!</line>
				<line>I'm feeling it right now too, and I don't even watch nerd shows!!</line>

				<line>NO</line>

				<line>GONNA HAVE TO STICK WITH NOPERS HERE</line>

				<line>It doesn't even make sense. If you carbonate a solid the best you're gonna get is a solid with carbon dioxide bubbles in it.

				<line>Sorry, other word classes!  I have a NEW girlfriend now!</line>
				<line>A homographic homophonic autantonym is a word that is spelt AND pronounced the same, but has two opposite and contradictory meanings!  For example, I can dust a crop (adding pesticides to it), or I can dust a counter (removing dust from it)!  Way to go, dust!  You are a winner; you are a word that contains multitudes.</line>
				<line>Why do we let language get like this?</line>
				<line>Probably because we want it to be incredibly awesome?</line>
				<line>And both "dust"s are the same part of speech there, too, so you can't use word order to determine meaning!</line>

				<line>ALL YOU CAN DO is hope to use your real-world knowledge about crops and tables to figure out what's going on.  And it's even worse with words like "overlook", meaning "examine" but ALSO meaning "miss noticing entirely".  Can't rely on the noun there!</line>
				<line>How come you love words that make communication difficult?</line>
				<line>What is not to like?  They're words that do their job in the most sarcastic, sullen, passive-aggressive way possible, and they totally get away with it!</line>

But what's neat is that we can look forward to the same thing if we ever encounter alien life!</line>
				<line>Except it's unlikely that we'd be vulnerable to their diseases.</line>
				<line>Well... MAYBE.</line>
				<line>But we don;t know anything about alien life!  Maybe they'll look just like us AND share diseases with us, but with pointier ears.  And logic?</line>
				<line>Or maybe they'll look like us, but, you know, ten times sexier.  Everyone on Earth will feel bad about their bodies for the rest of time!</line>

				<line>"We Need Leaders Who Actually Understand Technology."  Ahem.  Amelia and Antonio Tony stood in the bedroom.  They were going to have sex!  This is how things looked like they were going to me, the omniscient third-person narrator: sexy times ahoy.</line>
				<line>'We need leaders who actually understand technology,' muttered Amelia!</line>
				<line>Antonio Tony nodded curtly, taking off his pants.  It was so obvious.  Amelia locked eyes with Antonio, paused, and took off her shirt.  Antonio smiled appreciatively.  'There are so many bad laws passed through a misunderstanding of how computers actually work,' he thought.  Amelia's breasts were pretty great.  Antonio was hot too but THIS omniscient third-person narrator is into the ladies.</line>
				<line>Writing more erotica, I see!</line>
				<line>This one's new!  It's POLITICALLY CHARGED.</line>
				<line>"Soon Antonio and Amelia had sex and it was great.  They decided they had a pretty good time.  Suddenly, you find yourself agreeing... We Need Leaders Who Actually Understand Technology!"</line>

				<line>If someone says something is "a whale of a good time", I'm expecting to see some marine life.</line>
				<line>Guys! I am not alone in this!</line>
				<line>The phrase has been ruined bye people making the obvious stupid joke. Now it's only used by zoos featuring whales, or by dads, when then are taking their kids to visit zoos featuring whales. It's also used by marine biologists, and dads, when they are taking their kids to visit marine biologists. IT'S NOT EVEN A GOOD JOKE! You are using the word "whale" when talking about a whale. That's not comedy! That's a literal use of adjectives.</line>
				<line>So you don't want to see marine life when someone says "a whale of a good time"? </line>
				<line>Not always!</line>
				<line>It should mean "a good time that is large or immense: METAPHORICALLY like a whale", but the metaphor's broken because it's always used on literal friggin' whales. "Dog-gone great" is getting there too. But Im gonna fight it, one person at a time!</line>

But I presume there was a point when a man could procure some snake oil and go door-to-door selling it, and maybe those guys wrecked it for the rest of us. Maybe they were all chumps. MAYBE they were all, in fact, SUPERCHUMPS.</line>
				<line>That may actually be the case!</line>
				<line>I knew it!!</line>
				<line>Yeah, early Western entrepreneurs tried to duplicate the successful Chinese snake oil they saw, but it failed to recognize the reason it had SOME effect was Chinese water snakes are high in eicosapentaenic acid, an anti inflammatory agent! Western snakes aren't, and so their medicine didn't work.</line>

				<line>IT WAS A STYLISTIC CHOICE!</line>
				<line>Sorry? Could your vocal chords and mouth repeat that?</line>
				<line>Pleonasms have legitimate uses! For example, if I wasn't sure my audience (YOU, T-Rex) would know what "panacea" meant, I might use a similar word, allowing you to deduce some of my semantics without needing an explanation.</line>

He doesn't want to be a copycat.  Assume for the sake of argument that he doesn't want to be a copycat.</line>

				<line>Yes!</line>

I don't need a "tweeeeet" to say hello.  I just put food in you and that is gonna have to be INTRODUCTION ENOUGH.</line>
				<line>Got any other body complaints?</line>
				<line>As a matter of fact, I DO.</line>

				<line>SITUATIONS IN WHICH TO USE "THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!"</line>
				<line>There are many situations in which "that's what she said!" may be appropriately used! For example, after someone says, uh,</line>
				<line>"What a good date!"</line>
				<line>That's TERRIBLE. T-Rex, you're supposed to use it to recontextualize an innocuous statement into a double entendre, not to indicate that both people on the date were happy. Here, say it after I stop talking. "You can stay in my guest house for a week."</line>
				<line>That's what SHE said!</line>
				<line>See? Actually, no, that's not so great either.</line>
				<line>Well, you can use "that's what she said!" when telling a story, too!</line>
				<line>Literally?</line>
				<line>Yeah, like - "Anneke said 'How do you do.' To clarify, that's what SHE said!"</line>
				<line>Ug. Here, look: "T-Rex, that certainly took a long time and I didn't enjoy it at all."</line>
				<line>That's what SHE said!</line>
				<line>Hah!</line>

				<line>That is without exaggeration, T-Rex, the weakest comment on climate change that I have ever heard, or am ever likely to hear!</line>
				<line>You've distilled an important issue down to "something might be happening I dunno, maybe??" Also, you don't even mention human influence on the climate, which is a serious concern!</line>

				<line>STORIES FOR MEN</line>
				<line>Men! We like stories, right?</line>
				<line>Three voices outside the picture: Right!</line>
				<line>But they have to be good stories. Stories with plots in which there are good guys and bad guys, and then some explosions happen to them!</line>
				<line>You sure like explosions, huh?</line>
				<line>In a good story, they function as punctuation marks. Hamlet says "To be or not to be", and the building behind him blows up. It is spectacular. The audience whispers, "Yes. This is what Shakespeare meant."</line>
				<line>So your story is Hamlet only with explosions instead of punctuation.</line>
				<line>You say it like it's not fantastic!</line>
				<line>Do the characters even react to the explosions at all?</line>
				<line>Sometimes they go off in the background and they barely glance over their shoulder at them. Sometimes they outrun them down halls or by climbing up ladders real fast. It depends on the scene, you know?</line>
				<line>THE ULTIMATE STORY FOR MEN</line>
				<line>Hamlet sips some whiskey while punching a man in the nose! Ophelia says she's crazy for him and they go on a helicopter ride. A ghost appears, and when Hamlet high fives him he explodes! Then Denmark explodes.</line>
				<line>Later, Ophelia's topless!</line>

			<panel>
				<line>AMAZING AND TRUE STORIES FROM THE LIFE OF UTAHRAPTOR</line>
				<line>also starring T-REX</line>
				<line>This morning I skipped breakfast and met T-Rex for lunch. He seemed excited. He always seems excited.</line>
				<line>I asked him why, and it turned out that Dromiceiomimus had a customer service issue with a shipping company, and wanted T-Rex to call because he's better at these sorts of things. They'd failed to deliver her package four times now. T-Rex already has "suckified delivery companies" on his revenge list (he'd said), so he was pleased to call. He spent ten minutes listing all the ways suckified delivery companies had made his life worse, got a full head of steam, and called them up. Long story short, the package had actually been delivered that morning. T-Rex claims victory.</line>
				<line>I actually ran into him (almost literally) later that afternoon, and we discussed it some more.</line>
				<line>My contrarian position (I freely admit it) was that he was wrong to chew out the lady on the phone: with companies this size, there's no way she was responsible for the package. Responsibility is so diffused that really, nobody is responsible - it's a system failure, and the person in the call centre can't change the system. He replied that as his only contact point, agents should expect complaints and offer solutions - he's not going to make allowances for someone else's broken system. We agreed to differ.</line>
				<line>I realize that this is my diary for the new year, and all I've written about so far is T-Rex. the responsibility for this, I feel, lies solely in this Christmas gift "stationary" from T-Rex himself. He's drawn himself in every panel, and the same pre-printed title takes up all the space in the first one. Still - grocery shopping's more fun.</line>

				<line>That- that was terrible.</line>
				<line>Man, she's right! It WAS terrible.</line>
				<line>What if you're out of jokes, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>WHAT?</line>
				<line>Yeah, what if you were born with a set number of funny jokes, and now you've used them all up?</line>
				<line>Don't even joke about that, Utahraptor! I rely on my sense of humour as a social lubricant! It's the secret to how come girls want to kiss me sometimes.</line>
				<line>LATER THAT DAY:</line>
				<line>Mr. Tusks! What if I'm clean out of funny jokes?</line>
				<line>Mr. Tusks: That would be a TINY bit inconvenient for me T-Rex! I need you to write a joke for my speech tomorrow to the Chiropractor's Union.</line>

				<line>Because check it out: if you assume that computers will continue to get better, then it stands to reason that one day we'll be able to simulate an entire universe.  And then there'll be a day shortly afterwards when we can simulate universe on our cell phones!  And once you imagine this possibility, what are the odds that OUR universe is the one real one?  It's much more likely that all creation is running in the background of some future dude's iPhone 3K!</line>
				<line>Seriously?  You're seriously arguing this old idea.</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Ghost have got to be the saddest thing ever! They're dead people PLUS they're blind.</line>
				<line>That's right, I said it! Ghosts are blind!</line>
				<line>They HAVE to be, because they're invisible! And light needs to hit something to be seen, and if ghosts have transparent eyes they're not going to see anything. PLUS you can walk right through a ghost, so sound waves will pass through them too. They're deaf and blind most of the time, and when they do become a little visible, the world that fades into focus around them is filled with people screaming at them in terror. It's so sad!</line>
				<line>You're picking apart the science of ghost senses, but accept the fact of their invisibility?</line>
				<line>Yep!</line>
				<line>Ghosts have to be invisible, at least part of the time - that's what makes them ghosts! But if you accept that, it's fun to try to see how ghostlike you can make them without making any FURTHER assumptions.</line>
				<line>But our friend Zach is a ghost, and he's not blind OR deaf!</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Ssh!  Come closer!</line>
				<line>I know more secrets!</line>
				<line>More SECRETS of the MEDICAL PROFESSION!</line>
				<line>Okay, so peritonitis is when your peritoneum gets infected, and the peritoneum is basically the lining for your abdominal cavity, where your guts are!  So if that's infected, you're going to be in pain whenever your belly moves.  And when the doctor walks in the room, he might see how you're sitting, cautious in your movements, guarding your belly, and he might suspect peritonitis.  And then he might "accidentally" bump into your bed or chair!</line>
				<line>If you start to scream from just that small bump, he'll know the peritonitis is bad!</line>
				<line>But why all the subterfuge?</line>
				<line>Well, they can just come up and say "I'm going to shake your belly so tell me if it hurts", but that primes the patient, and they'll be LOOKING to feel pain.  The bump can get you an unsolicited result and lets you quickly ascertain degree!</line>
				<line>So if you scream, they suspect bad-times peritonitis.</line>
				<line>Yep!  And then they'll send you for emergency surgery.  Did you know that one of peritonitis' causes is your BOWELS becoming PERFORATED so that RAW SEWAGE sloshes around in your belly?</line>
				<line>Man, bodies are nasty!  I can TOTALLY SEE why nascent machine intelligences don't wanna hang with us.</line>

				<line>Wow, that actually sounds like good business advice, T-Rex.  Customers want to buy something they're already familiar with!</line>
				<line>I know, right?  But I totally just made it up, according to my Generative Advice Formula.  And I have tons more!  Like, for a restaurant: "Customers eat what they see, but they see what they eat."</line>
				<line>That one is less impressive.</line>
				<line>Maybe because it follows the first one?</line>
				<line>Your formula is "Customers VERB1 what they VERB2, but they VERB2 what they VERB1", for all transitive verbs, right?</line>
				<line>Okay YEAH it's obvious, but it works!  And it can be customized to any environment.  Self-help?  "Do what you want, but want what you do."  Writers?  "Write what you know, but know what you write."</line>
				<line>Oh, yeah?  What about colonists?</line>

Others have distinct personalities associated with numbers or letters, so that the letter "M" might be polite while "7" gets all up in everyone's fries.  They still sense normally, it's just they've got this extra layer of perception on top of what the rest of us get.  I admit to being jealous!</line>

		<title>anyway a week later t-rex is forced to go through with this and kisses a guy who found out he only has a month to live. it doesn't work out and the last month ends up being super awkward for everyone involved. the end!</title>

				<line>Some people do not cherish awkward moments as I do. Lukily for them, I have come up with a solution!</line>
				<line>The solution, as in most things, is smooching!</line>
				<line>Awkward moments are awkward because nobody knows what to do or say. But if you swoop in for a kiss, it's no longer an awkward moment! You've avoided it entirely by transitioning it into a moment of "OH GREAT WHAT THE HACK NOW I HAVE TO SLAP THIS PERSON FOR THEIR UNWANTED ADVANCES" or even a moment of "OH GREAT WHAT THE HECK NOW THEY LOVE ME TOO"</line>
				<line>I feel like you haven't thought this out, T-Rex.</line>
				<line>I - I really do.</line>
				<line>My friend, if you're going to be doing that much kissing, you'd better brush up a bit on it!</line>
				<line>	wHAT?</line>
				<line>I'm serious! If you kiss someone and it's a sucky kiss, that just escalates the awkward moment!  And I don't mean to brag, but I'm a pretty great kisser.  One time I kissed a guy and he said, UNSOLICITED, that it was the best kiss he'd ever had.</line>
				<line>Seriously? Can you teach me?</line>
				<line>with - words?</line>
				<line>THAT EVENING:</line>
				<line>Nobody even noticed how I made my examples of the awkward moment kiss gender neutral!</line>
				<line>It's so you can imagine a man slapping a woman after an unwanted kiss, and then you get to examine your ideas of gender roles and heteronormativity</line>

		<title>what is the upper bound on the speed of the treadmill, given perfect manufacturing techniques? i imply it's terminal velocity but i really don't know. randall? any help?</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>I would like to have an inclined treadmill, so that I could build an indoor skateboarding track.  Am I that crazy?</line>
				<line>Am I that crazy... TO DREAM?</line>
				<line>The idea is that it's like a moving sidewalk, but the speed is computer controlled!  So you hop on your skateboard and get on the track, and within a few moments the speed of the treadmill is exactly matching the speed your board would otherwise be travelling at!  You're not moving, but the board FEELS like it's travelling at speed.</line>
				<line>The slogan will be, "Yes.  You can skateboard in your apartment in winter."</line>
				<line>So it's like a reverse Segway, only the computer controls speed by moving the ground, instead of the wheels.</line>
				<line>Sure!</line>
				<line>But can you imagine how fun it would be, to have that sensation of movement indoors, while not actually moving?</line>
				<line>And hey, if you fall, you'll be whipped backwards at the speed you were travelling at!</line>
				<line>Here's a solution to that!  DON'T FALL DOWN??</line>
				<line>But you're describing a virtual infinite hill.  The treadmill will eventually have to be moving at terminal velocity!</line>
				<line>Oh yeah, NOBODY is gonna want to buy the TERMINAL VELOCITY SKATEBOARD SIMULATOR.</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Okay, so whatever. MAYBE the Terminal Velocity Skateboard Simulator would never reach terminal velocity, since there's no wind resistance. But do we not have an obligation to future generations to make sure??</line>
				<line>NOPE</line>
				<line>Whatever! If I were in the future and I could open up a book and see "The awesome terminal velocity skateboard didn't work, OH WELL", then I would do that.</line>
				<line>I don't think you would, T-Rex! Because you could basically do that today, if you wanted to read up on the physics. The issue is that even with the ground moving, the board is going to slide down the ramp because of gravity.</line>
				<line>Ridiculous! There's friction in the wheels that -</line>
				<line>- wouldn't be enough!</line>
				<line>The treadmill speeds up to match the board's forward momentum, right? But if you've got impossibly perfect bearings, that's just going to make the wheels go faster while the board still slides down. So it's just the friction in the bearings that can keep you in place, and at the levels we're talking about, your wheels would melt first!</line>
				<line>FINE. You know what? FINE. I'm done dreaming!</line>
				<line>{{In T-Rex's thoughts.}} Bathroom symbol for women: t-rex we symbolically represent sexy babes who forgot our clothes today! wooo!</line>

				<line>Guys! Guys!</line>
				<line>I came up with a way to get my skateboard treadmill to work!</line>
				<line>All I need is a treadmill that tilts!</line>
				<line>That way, rather than relying on friction and stuff to manage the position of the skateboarder, I can just tilt the incline up or down in order to keep them in the right position. Then, hey presto, it works and physics is happy! FOR ONCE.</line>
				<line>Alternatively, I could have a giant fan, like the kind used in skydiving simulators, and use air to help keep the skateboarder where I want him to be.</line>
				<line>Both of these seem like pretty expensive solutions!</line>
				<line>It's true!</line>
				<line>And I realized: if I do have this giant fan, it'll be way more fun to use it OFFENSIVELY than it'd be to simulate skating indoors. So anyway, I bought the fan, installed it on my house and now I blow enemies off my lawn.</line>
				<line>Ha, no way!</line>

				<line>Wouldn't it be great if people didn't need to be happy?</line>
				<line>YES.  Yes it probably would!</line>
				<line>I mean, I get that depression (UNhappiness) has a host of issues associated with it, but what I'm describing is more Ahappiness - the ability to not need happiness at all!  Happiness is this - this FUEL that we need to function in society, but it doesn't last forever, and then we need to find more.  It's like food, only it's drained every time we have to do something sucky!  Also, you can't buy happiness at a grocery store.  I'm sorry, Safeway, but you just CAN'T.</line>
				<line>But what if I removed that desire for happiness?  What if instead of feeding the world, I simply killed hunger?</line>
				<line>T-Rex!</line>
				<line>This is crazy!  You can't just pluck an emotion out of the psyche, and we don't have technology that even approaches this.  When did you ever think you were going to do this?</line>

				<line>It - it came in the mail?</line>
				<line>Somehow word got out that I'm a Nazi Pin Guy and now I have everyone else's Nazi pins.  And flags.  And uniforms and boots and chapeaus.  I basically have a WWII Re-Enactment Society in my basement, Dromiceiomimus.  BUT ONLY FOR ONE SIDE.</line>
				<line>Your problems just seem to - escalate, huh?</line>
				<line>I wish I knew why</line>
				<line>Give it to a museum, T-Rex! They'll take it!</line>
				<line>That's a great idea!</line>
				<line>My pin was too common to interest a museum, but the rest of this stuff COULD be given away like that!</line>
				<line>Right, and you could probably find history teachers to take the more common artifacts!</line>
				<line>Wow, all I have to do is follow your advice, and all my problems are solved!</line>
				<line>LATER:</line>
				<line>Offstage: I don't understand why you're paying me to slip this Nazi memorabilia into the pockets of strangers.</line>

			<panel>
				<line>How come car bumpers aren't all at the same height on cars? It's dumb that they're not. The whole point of bumpers is to cushion bumps, but if they don't meet, then they only serve as Impact Hasteners.</line>
				<line>I could say this is one situation in which the free market fails! But I won't!</line>
				<line>I can already see where that would go: a discussion of how style sells cars and bumpers are subject to that, but how government controls could legislate that all bumpers be a standard height, thereby saving lives. THEN, we could segue into internationalization problems with how foreign car makers might not want to redesign their cars for only our market, but we still need cars, so hey, let's talk corporate control over our national interests! AND SO ON.</line>

			<panel>
				<line>I have come up with the ultimate disaster movie! It is called "OH GOSH: A SERIES OF DISASTERS" and what happens is a guy gets out of bed, stubs his toe and says,</line>
				<line>"Oh, GOSH!"</line>
				<line>Then he falls down the stairs!</line>
				<line>Then he smashes through a load-bearing beam at the bottom and his house collapses! And then a spark from a broken lamp ignites the gas, and his house explodes, shooting the guy out into the sky and lighting the surrounding houses on fire. By the time the fire department arrives the entire block is aflame, and also, their fire truck is on fire. Then the fire reaches a power station, causes a cascade failure, and power goes down for the enitre country, and soon, the world!</line>
				<line>The power failure goes worldwide?</line>
				<line>The guys in charge of preventing that were watching the fires on TV!</line>
				<line>Anyway, things progress and characters keep saying "What is with this... Series of Disasters?" It's so good, Utahraptor. Volcanoes erupt, earthquakes strike, and meteors hit just as soon as all the other stuff gets boring.</line>
				<line>And let me guess: at the end the Earth explodes?</line>
				<line>Yes, but after the credits, the original guy wakes up and says "Whew! It was all a dream!" Then he gets out of bed, STUBS HIS TOE, turns to the camera in terror, wide-eyed, and screams "Oh GOSSSSSH!!!"</line>
				<line>Holy crap. There's nothing not to like in my movie.</line>

				<line>THE AMAZING STORY OF EDWARD S. CURTIS. Edward S. Curtis was a photographer of American Indians in the early 1900s! I know he was tough because his middle name was "Sheriff".</line>
				<line>For most of his life he documented the disappearing "great race" of the Indian!</line>
				<line>He took over 40 thousand photographs - not bad for one guy! And in many cases, his records are the only recorded history we've got. But what's amazing about Curtis is that he specifically set out to record the doomed people his culture imagined Indians to be: the noble savage, the Indian that was alien, stoic, exotic and dying.</line>
				<line>And when he met Indians that DIDN'T meet his expectations, he just changed them for his photographs.</line>
				<line>How?</line>
				<line>Man, he carried boxes of "Indian" clothing and wigs with him: ethnic signifiers for his subjects if they didn't look Indian enough! And his Indian was clean-shaven, so he'd pay men to shave.</line>
				<line>It's an interesting conflict in the guy: record the Indian before they "die out", but already know what you want to see.</line>
				<line>Yep! I think it's amazing how we've still got this idea of the Indian that we look for. If there's no headdress we're disappointed!</line>

				<line>The Beach Boys... well, it seems the Beach Boys wish they were older, living together, and sleeping with each other.</line>
				<line>They describe such a scenario as "nice"!</line>
				<line>Other scenarios they describe as "nice" include all five Beach Boys waking up together, spending the day together, and then holding each other close. They also wish their kisses were neverending, as that would be nice, and they wish they were all married, they'd be happy. "Wouldn't [that] be nice?", they ask each other in the chorus, largely rhetorically.</line>
				<line>They're talking to a GIRL, T-Rex, not each other!</line>
				<line>So heteronormative!</line>
				<line>Listen, if there's a group of people on stage and they start out throwing out "wouldn't it be nice if WE were older"s, I don't imagine a hypothetical female third party! I look at THEM.</line>
				<line>They address later lyrics to "baby"!</line>

				<line>T-Rex, I'm really sorry, but I can't do this anymore.  I can't be with someone I can't communicate with.</line>
				<line>Please hand me the customs declaration form.</line>
				<line>See?  I don't even know who you are!</line>

				<line>This is carry-on baggage.</line>
				<line>We've tried to make allowances for you, but it's just so impossible to be your friend.  I don't even know what you're thinking right now!  Everything you say is like this impossible linguistic Rorschach test.</line>

				<line>Not enough things glow in the dark.</line>
				<line>That's right! I said it!!</line>
				<line>Not enough things glow in the dark, AND, the things that glow in the dark don't glow in the dark for long enough. Even if I had a glow-in-the-dark skull it would only glow for like, two minutes. That is only two kinds of spooky: spookily sucky and spookily DISAPPOINTING.</line>
				<line>All I ever wanted is a plastic skull that lights up in the dark, so that in the dark, everyone can see my spooky plastic skull!</line>
				<line>This sounds like a battery problem, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>Alright, fine, so it's a battery problem!</line>
				<line>But the issue is that batteries are hard to design: you want to store large amounts of energy for cheap, but you also don't want them to, you know, explode. It's tricky!</line>
				<line>I don't need a laptop battery! All I want is a spooky skull, so that when criminals break into my house, they see a grim visage of things to come.</line>
				<line>LAST NIGHT:</line>
				<line>T-Rex (thinking): Oh no! are those criminals breaking into my house?!</line>
				<line>Criminals: We're criminals, but we're afraid of skulls. Lucky thing it's dark, because even if there were some here, we wouldn't see them!</line>
				<line>T-Rex (thinking): Nooooooooo</line>

		<title>william shakespeare: "now cracks a noble heart. good-night, sweet prince; and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest." ryan north: "shakespeare was a famous writer guy"</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Shakespeare was a famous writer guy, but we know basically nothing about him!  There's only a handful of times when we know what he was doing on a given day.</line>
				<line>And at other times, there's no record of him for years and years!</line>
				<line>The fact that we have any record of him as a person at all is only due to the fact that he appeared in court a few times as a witness, and that he got married.  Legal records are all we've got!  His interests and tastes, politics and loves "#8212; they all have to be (unreliably) extrapolated from his writing.</line>
				<line>Well, he IS from the past, and 80% of the plays from his time survive as titles alone!  We're lucky to have the data we do.</line>
				<line>That's true!  I just wish we knew more about the man, you know?</line>
				<line>You're not alone in that!</line>
				<line>So let's agree!  If one of us ever get a chance to go back in time, and we run into him, then we'll definitely ask Shakespeare what he was up to.  What he likes, what his interests are "#8212; all the stuff historians wish they had!</line>
				<line>Hah!  Okay, it's a deal!</line>
				<line>MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND!</line>
				<line>SHAKESPEARE!  OH SHAKESPEARE!  DO YOU KNOW WHERE MY CAR KEYS ARE, SHAKESPEARE</line>
				<line>Shakespeare: alack me!  i'm trying to write some sonnets here, t-rex!</line>
				<line>HEY SHAKESPEARE!</line>

		<title>imaginary australian batman needs to stop having such a stereotypical viewpoint about australian batman</title>

			<panel>
				<line>BEFORE we had dictionaries, words could be spelt in a variety of different ways. Now that we have dictionaries, spellings are fixed.</line>
				<line>This I accept!</line>
				<line>It speeds up reading AND comprehension, and spelling errors give editors "easy points" when looking for something to edit.  FINE.  But we've lost the ability to encode the way words are spoken: the pronunciation and accents of a speaker!  We can get a little of that back through capitalization and creative! punctuation! but still - it's hard in text to tell an Australian from an American, assuming they're both speaking English.</line>
				<line>The result of this is a proliferation of stereotypes!</line>
				<line>How so?</line>
				<line>Well, say I'm writing a story about Australian Batman and I want to show people that Batman's Australian now. Spelling means I can't rely on his accent, so I'm forced to have him call people "mate" and grimly refer to "shrimps" placed upon "barbies". It's the only way!</line>
				<line>Um - pretty sure there are others!</line>
				<line>LATER</line>

				<line>Title: HELPFUL TIPS FOR ESSAY WRITING</line>
				<line>Students! Are you having trouble writing essays? Maybe they're a little short?</line>
				<line>Maybe just a little?</line>
				<line>Well then, here are some friggin' tips!!</line>
				<line>Okay, so everyone knows about making margins wide and using a big font, but teachers know that one too. They see it and they think "Come on, you can do better," and then they uncap their red pens and write "You could use some friggin' tips!" all over your cover page.</line>
				<line>Has that ever happened to you?</line>
				<line>Nope! But that's because *I* happen to use a little friggin' thing called "tips"!</line>
				<line>So let's hear these tips then!</line>
				<line>Prepare yourself to be friggin' fipped, my friend!</line>
				<line>Ben Chuckles: CUT!</line>
				<line>Ben Chuckles: I'm sorry, but we don't think you're right for the role. We're really looking for an actor who doesn't add "friggin'" to each of his lines.</line>
				<line>Well then!</line>
				<line>It looks like YOU'VE got the wrong friggin' guy!!</line>

				<line>Man, I don't need that acting job anyway! I can get by on my good looks and charm ANYWAY, and "essay writing tips" are easy.</line>
				<line>Easy!</line>
				<line>For example, here's a tip! Maybe you could try understanding the topic at hand and expressing your views on it in a clear yet persuasive manner?</line>
				<line>When I was in high school, I'd increase the font size on all my periods from 12 points to 14 points, thereby extending my paper in a way that was very difficult to detect!</line>
				<line>Dromieciomimus! I am shocked!!</line>
				<line>Man, I just added "very" in front of my adjectives!</line>
				<line>What? For reals?</line>
				<line>Of course! It was a great way to extend the length of my essay, AND it made my points more emphatic. "Trees are tall and pretty" became "Trees are very tall and very very pretty. Verily!"</line>
				<line>What, you were The Mighty Thor?</line>
				<line>Only in essays, my friend! Only in essays.</line>
				<line>LATER:</line>
				<line>Hello, radio call in show? Did you know Utahraptor abused the word "very" in all his essays?</line>
				<line>Radio Host: I've told you: this isn't an advice show! It's a show about RVs.</line>
				<line>Okay but did you not hear the rest of my question though?</line>

				<line>I like it when commercials license pop songs and then make up their own product centric lyrics.  It's a window into an alternate corporate-controlled universe!</line>
				<line>An alternate corporate controlled universe where all songwriters have brain damage?</line>
				<line>The lyrics are always so terrible and the songs entirely arbitrary.  It's like - it's like they license "Candle in the Wind" and then have some Elton John sound-alike singing "Goodbye, Norma Jeane / Did you ever / Use Duracell / They make some fine batteries / On this we all should dwell"</line>
				<line>Hah!  You know, I'd watch that commercial.</line>
				<line>It's so representative!</line>
				<line>Now do "Somewhere Over The Rainbow"!</line>
				<line>Sure!  Um... how about -</line>
				<line>"Someone's Sara-Lee branded / cherry pie / makes me glad that I've heard that / they're now in high supply"</line>
				<line>Hilarious!  It makes me want to buy a Sara-Lee branded cherry pie.</line>
				<line>It's not that hard!  You just imagine being good, and then don't do that.</line>
				<line>THAT EVENING (SET TO THE TUNE OF "WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD"):</line>
				<line>Radio (quietly): I see leaves of green / red onions too / I see them here, for me and you / And I think to myself: / "What A Wonderful Pre-Packaged Asian-Style Salad from Loblaw's Grocery."</line>

				<line>Man, who hasn't written a story about a Man With A Problem for a while? Is it me?</line>
				<line>I'm pretty sure the answer is "YES!"</line>
				<line>So my new story will be about a man whose problem is he weeps all the time. He's not sad, his eyes just produce water like it's going out of style. And he tells everyone that it's just a biological thing and he's very happy to see them, but they all suspect he's sad. They say "Are you alright?" and he says "YES dammit I just got leaky eyes." Then he locks his weeping eyes with them and says "What's for dinner?"</line>
				<line>It sounds like he's a pretty unsettling character!</line>
				<line>No man, he's nice! He just weeps all the time.</line>
				<line>I'm going to use it to explore PREJUDICE. What's it like to be a man of tears in a world where most men don't even like to cry at weddings? He faces a lot of preconceptions.</line>
				<line>How does he deal with it?</line>
				<line>Sometimes, in his most private moments - the tears are real.</line>
				<line>Story Quote: The airline had a strict "no crybabies" policy, and wouldn't let him board, no matter how he protested. Prejudice. He pointed at his eyes. "See these? These are tears of PITY." But as he stormed out of the terminal, he knew that they were really tears of frustration, mixed with the standard tears he always produced.</line>

				<line>I really don't think dreams are important?</line>
				<line>I didn't think that MOST people thought that dreams were all that important, but I must be in a minority, because I keep seeing fiction that uses dreams as very significant symbolism. And the worst is when stories end on these significant Dreams, because in my mind, I'm thinking "This is ridiculous; when will we get back to the real story? This is entirely irrelevant." and then it's over and I think "Oh. Huh."</line>

				<line>Sometimes it can be hard to name characters.  Here's a tip: name them after other, more famous characters, and add in some Roman numerals!  If you want to show that a character is tough, name him Genghis II.  If your character is this big lover guy who has fallen for, um, a 14-year-old, call him "Romeo IV"!  Hey presto!  Suddenly your characters write themselves!</line>

				<line>The problem with Superman, and Spider-Man, AND Batman, and pretty much every other superhero, is that their stories don't have ends. They're all stuck in the same productive age range, 20-30 years old, and it's easy to see why!</line>
				<line>Companies don't want their most popular characters dying of old age!</line>
				<line>But the result is that their stories don't have ENDS. We don't know how Batman deals with a failing body and the rigours of old age, how Spider-Man reacts when Mary Jane loses her looks. I mean, we DO, because sometimes out-of-continuity stories explore this, but they're never for real - they don't count! Bats is always 30 again in the next story. It's like David fights Goliath, but they keep fighting every few issues for 50 years, and you never see how it ends.</line>
				<line>You know, there are a lot of interesting parallels here with soap operas!</line>
				<line>How so?</line>
				<line>Soaps have long-running narratives, but characters die all the time. The difference is soaps focus on PREMISE rather than individuals, so they're not killing a cash cow when someone dies. They just bring in someone new!</line>
				<line>So Batman dies, and the book focuses on his butler Alfred working for Spider-Man instead!</line>
				<line>[[T-Rex's thought bubble:</line>
				<line>Alfred: Sir, I am old and conservative. You can't expect me to "loosen up" overnight.</line>

				<line>"HORSES VS. TRAINS"</line>
				<line>Ah, the age-old debate! Horses are okay.</line>
				<line>If you don't have any trains around, that is!!</line>
				<line>Horses eat grass. Trains are huge multi-ton machines that GET THINGS DONE. And then when you think trains are as great as it gets, you discover maglev trains! These are literal HOVERTRAINS that wrote in their diaries, "Screw it, diary! I'm just gonna go as fast as I can from now on!!" and then they go 581 km/h like it's no big deal. NICE. Horses eat grass, and SOMETIMES, hop over buckets.</line>
				<line>I guess the old stereotype of boys liking trains is true!</line>
				<line>Come on, that's dumb!</line>
				<line>I like trains because they're big complicated machines that NOT ONLY get folks places quickly, but also, threaten maidens tied to the tracks by mustachio-twirling villains. If horses could do that I would like horses too. </line>
				<line>I'm pretty sure horses CAN do that. </line>
				<line>WELL THEN. I GUESS I'M A FAN OF HORSES.</line>
				<line>LATER:</line>
				<line>EXCUSE ME LIBRARIAN DO YOU HAVE ANY BOOKS ON HORSES</line>
				<line>Librarian: Yes sir! We have books on many topics, here at your local library!</line>
				<line>THANK YOU PRETTY SURE ONE WILL SUFFICE</line>

				<line>It's terrible, Dromiceiomimus! All my life I was certain that explosions could spice up ANY narrative, but I've been blowing my main characters up ALL THE TIME and they're still not that interesting! Check this out: "Antonio Tony and Samantha were explosive-expert friends who decided one day to try kissing each other. It wasn't that bad! Later on, one of them decided that it was actually pretty bad."</line>
				<line>THE END?</line>
				<line>I think your problem is you're focusing on plot!</line>
				<line>How do you figure?</line>
				<line>Romance is about two CHARACTERS meeting and falling in love, but all you've got is narrative. We don't really know anything about your protagonists, so we don't care what happens to them. Flesh them out!</line>
				<line>Oh kay!</line>
				<line>T-Rex's Story: Samantha was a cowgirl, always on the lookout for a SPUR-of-the-moment marriage. Antonio Tony was a horse enthusiast. "I hope to be SADDLED with a wife soon!" he thought to himself. They waved wildly at each other across the open plains.</line>

		<body>

				<line>Today is a good day I think for assuming that there's such thing as a soul!</line>
				<line>Assumption: assumed!</line>
				<line>And given this assumption, and the assumption that people care about exploring the idea of a soul, we can easily cast ghosts and zombies as the investigation of the soul-having experience that they are. For what are ghosts, but souls without a body? And what are zombies, but bodies without a soul?</line>
				<line>In summary and in conclusion, ghosts and zombies allow us to explore the intricacies of soul (and body!) ownership.</line>
				<line>So why are both these "explorations of the soul" found in horror stories?</line>
				<line>It's easy!</line>
				<line>As people with bodies AND assumed souls, we find the idea of divorcing one from the other terrifying; therefore, the only way we can explore the consequences of these is through the lens of horror. Tada!</line>
				<line>Honestly, I think your theory is a little pat. It doesn't consider all possibilities!</line>

				<line>There are many kinds of grief, so I've focused on a particular flavour. When, say, a big meteor hits a dude square on the head and kills him, that's sad. HOWEVER, at the same time, it's also extremely amazing and awesome. It can be hard to reconcile these two, conflicting, emotions.</line>
				<line>So what's your solution?</line>
				<line>I propose a new word!</line>
				<line>Have you noticed how that's your solution to every problem?</line>
				<line>And have you noticed how it ALWAYS WORKS?</line>
				<line>Today I propose a word meaning "extremely sad, but also extremely amazing". It can be hard to pull off that emotion; you don't want people thinking you're TOO into how amazing it was. But if you say, "I'm very [my new word] right now", everyone understands! Grief has become easier to navigate!</line>
				<line>I call my new word "sawesome"!</line>

I ran to the door to close it and pressed up against it as the windows in the house blew inward and radioactive dust covered us all. THEN, after it was quier and we ventured outside, I ran into my friends who surved, but we all agreed we'd had too much radiation and wouldn't make it. It was really realistic!</line>
				<line>Sounds like a pretty standard nightmare, my friend!</line>
				<line>I know! I was stoked!</line>
				<line>But then these - stupid atomic zombies showed up? And they started zapping us with cheap-ass lightning bolts coming otu of thier eyes? It was super dumb, Urahraptor. It was that cheap 60s lightning where they just draw it directly on the film</line>

				<line>When I was younger, I went to the dentist a lot. MAYBE I DIDN'T BRUSH MY TEETH THAT WELL, OKAY? OR THAT OFTEN, OR AT ALL.</line>
				<line>Oh well?</line>
				<line>But I remember sitting there when I was sixteen or so, with some stranger's fingers in my mouth as he scraped away at my teeth and thinking "MAN, this is a sucky time! I wish I had something to distract me. I bet if I'd had sex, then I could think about sex, and that would be distracting. Hey! I should have sex! It'll make visits to the dentist easier."</line>
				<line>So then what happened?</line>
				<line>Later, I had sex! Later still, I went back to the dentist.</line>
				<line>But it didn't work. The situation was so unerotic, and I was terrified of becoming visibly aroused!</line>
				<line>Did you tell the woman you had sex with that the REAL reason for it was so that you could be entertained at the dentist's?</line>
				<line>No! I mean, it wasn't the reason! That was just an added bonus!</line>

				<line>I mean, YES it is, but what if the one guy KNEW what everyone should be doing? What if he was actually the best person to be in charge of the country?</line>
				<line>Some people would still want to be free!</line>
				<line>But WHAT IF he recognized that and let those people be free?</line>
				<line>You're saying if there was a guy who could produce utopia, you'd want him in charge.</line>
				<line>Exactly! Yes!</line>
				<line>Okay, but that's not fascism. Fascism is authoritarian and includes these ideas of unity and purity and stuff like that. It's a sort of xenophobic culty nationalism?</line>

In a way, our bodies do affect who we are: if you've got a strong body, you can be a different person than someone in a weaker body.  Trivially, a weak-bodied person wouldn't make a good bully!</line>
				<line>I asked none of these questions</line>

				<line>I - okay?!</line>
				<line>Well, Utahraptor, I'll agree with you, and clarify that it's a necessary but not a sufficient condition.  Bodies affect the life experiences possible, and therefore personality!  And while you're questioning my premise of "nature over nurture" I'll clarify that I'm simply saying that someone in a weak body can't be a very effective bully!</line>

				<line>When people sign a prenuptial agreement, they agree, BEFORE they get married, how to divide up the assets in the event of a divorce!</line>
				<line>PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENTS: WHAT'S THE DEAL</line>
				<line>What gets me is the whole conflict in them: the position of "I love you and want to spend the rest of my life with you", with the caveat of "Oh, baby, but just in case". I understand on a PRACTICAL level about how prenups are - practical, but on the level of love, I don't see how you're allowd to hedge your bets when it comes to marriage! I thought marriage was the ultimate expression of love.</line>
				<line>And you see prenups as being the ultimate expression of love*.</line>
				<line>That's it exactly! Love with an asterisk.</line>
				<line>Well, honestly, T-Rex, I think that it's INCREDIBLY presumptuous of you to say that.</line>

				<line>Maybe I have been too hard on prenups. In a sense, they're sort of a Love Validater, right?</line>
				<line>PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENTS: WELL, MAYBE THIS IS THE DEAL</line>
				<line>Because if you have a prenup that says, "Wow, NOBODY'S getting rich off this marriage", then it's clear that nobody's getting married for the money. The only reason left is love!</line>
				<line>Or loneliness.</line>
				<line>Or love! The prenup is a way of announcing AND VERIFYING that you love them for Who They Are, not for what they've got in their pants! In their wallet in their pants. It was a great metaphor, Dromiceiomimus.</line>
				<line>You know, Judaism has long had the "ketubah", which is basically a prenup!</line>
				<line>Really!</line>
				<line>Yep! It specifies divorce penalties but ALSO marital vows, and is hung up in the house. Prenups can mean a lot of different things to people!</line>
				<line>Huh! Maybe the best way to learn about prenups is to get one. Oh my gosh, Utahraptor!! Let's get a "friendship prenup"!</line>

				<line>Now everyone thinks MY dog has super powers!</line>
				<line>I don't know at what point we all decided that authors aren't allowed to just make things up anymore, but it's totally what's happened to me! Somehow our fictions have all become real, and "write what you know" is the only creative option.</line>

				<line>In my story there's a new Lolita, and she's thirty, and she goes out with a man who's also thirty and from a similar economic and social background! They get married and have some okay times. Years later, all the characters die of old age!</line>
				<line>It seems a bit - conservative!</line>
				<line>I could make some changes! But did you notice how everyone was clearly of the age of majority though?</line>
				<line>THE BOOK IS PUBLISHED:</line>
				<line>T-Rex, your new book is basically terrible!</line>
				<line>*gasp*</line>
				<line>I'm serious! The "new Lolita" has nothing to do with the old one, and nothing interesting happens except when "LoHEta" shows up, explains that he's the new manly male Lolita, and then leaves the narrative entirely.</line>
				<line>He shows up again in the epilogue! Utahraptor! You didn't even finish my book!</line>
				<line>At the end, Loheta addresses the reader directly and explains that if you replace "she" with "he" and "hers" with "definitely his" in the ORIGINAL Lolita, you can read all about his adventures!</line>

				<line>So what happened then?</line>
				<line>Well, I was staring!</line>
				<line>And you noticed it, obviously, but then you turned to me, made eye contact, and nodded with an almost undetectable Mona Lisa smile, just once. It was this amazing nod that said, "Don't worry, T-Rex. Things will be alright. Everything's gonna work out fine."</line>

				<line>Let's do it!!</line>
				<line>There's simple ones like "I promise to clean your room" (your future is now altered), but there's bigger ones like "I now pronounce you husband and wife": you weren't married before, and now, oh my God you guys, you're totally married!  And then there's "I hereby christen this ship 'HMS Sinkytowne'" and "I sentence you to death by misadventure".</line>

				<line>Sure is!!</line>
				<line>Yeah, but you're only legally married when you sign the paperwork!</line>
				<line>Well - </line>
				<line>And it's the same with christenings and sentences AND declarations of war: they all require paperwork!  I'D argue that the performative utterance is just part of the ceremony, and that the real change is made when you sign on the dotted line.</line>

				<line>A leader declares war on television, then that's war, regardless of whether he's signed the paperwork yet.  He's changed the world just by talking!  With sentencing it's the same:  the judge tells you your sentence and that's it, and the paperwork is just that - paperwork!  RECORDKEEPING.  And the same for marriages!  The license is just to let the GOVERNMENT know what's already happened.  I was right!  I was totally right!!</line>

		<title>how do we know when and how words changed pronunciation, if they weren't written down? well sir, we look at sucky rhymes in poems and presume they used to work, and also at books written during the shift complaining how kids today keep talkin' wrong</title>

				<line>In the 15th and 16th centuries, spoken English changed dramatically, with vowels changing pronunciation and moving upwards in the mouth. Before it, we all sounded like ye olde-fashioned chumps. Afterwards, we all sounded hip and modern!</line>
				<line>It was a century of kids outcooling their parents!</line>
				<line>Before, "boots" was pronounced "boats", and "feet" like "fate". PRETTY OLD FASHIONED, dudes! But what's amazing is that the printing press was invented just before this started, and it was at this point that the spellings of words really got fixed. That's why English has so many oddly-spelt words! They show the pronunciation of words as they were, just before we underwent the Great Vowel Shift and decided to, you know, say everything differently.</line>
				<line>And nobody knows why it happened!</line>
				<line>I know! It's so amazing!</line>
				<line>Linguists are like, "Maybe immigration from the Black Death caused regional accents to be absorbed?" and then another says, "Maybe the English wanted to distinguish their language from the hated French?" and then they both shrug at each other!</line>

				<line>Hey peasants! Tell all your friends to pronounce "boner" like "bone-air", okay? It'll make the future HILARIOUS.</line>

				<line>Computers have gotten way better in recent years. A new computer can beat a moldy old one from twenty years ago!</line>
				<line>FACT.</line>
				<line>Wouldn't it be great if rhetoric had evolved in the same way? I could have this hyper-evolved speaking that could convince anyone to do whatever I say, as long as they didn't have similar rhetorical powers to match! Anyone not inured to my amazing powers of speechifying would be putty in my hands. "Oh, T-Rex, I'm not sure I should do this" they'd say, and then I'd say "Oh maybe you should though" and they'd be all, "Awesome."</line>
				<line>It would be a disaster for society!</line>
				<line>Rude, my friend!</line>
				<line>I meant if there was such an advance. Early language learners would acquire languages the best, so it would be a generation of toddlers convincing their parents that letting them poop their pants is sweet. If you don't see what's bad for society in that, well - enjoy pooping your pants!</line>
				<line>T-Rex (thinking): The word 'poop' is cool: it's transitive, but only for 'pants'. You can pee your pants too though. Maybe it's the noun 'pants'? Further research certainly seems warranted.</line>

				<line>In conversations, speakers generally try to make helpful contributions, and listeners generally assume that this is the case! This is called the "cooperative principle", and philosopher Paul Grice proposed it! He's dead now.</line>
				<line>It's useful because it allows inferred meanings!</line>
				<line>We can be at a party and someone can say "Where's Utahraptor?" and I can say "He's sick" and they understand that he's not here BECAUSE he's sick. Inferred meaning! If they don't assume I'm cooperating then I'm just offering non-relevant information, on the same level as if I answered "Utahraptor's got shufflepants." and then clarified "They're pants that shuffle when he walks."</line>
				<line>But maybe I'm not at the party BECAUSE of my shufflepants!</line>

There's the Maxim of Quality (don't lie), the maxim of quantity (only say enough to make your point, no more or less), the Maxim of Relation (be relevant) and the Maxim of Manner (be clear, brief, and unambiguous). These are four different different ways we cooperate with each other when communicating!</line>
				<line>And if I were to say "I kissed him with my lips on the lips", that would be breaking Quantity!</line>
				<line>Yes!</line>

				<line>GREGOR MACGREGOR COMICS</line>
				<line>That name is totally made up. It was made up by a Scottish Enthusiast.</line>
				<line>I'm just sayin'.</line>
				<line>Anyway, Gregor MacGregor was this explorer guy in the 1800s!</line>
				<line>In 1820 he sailed from the Mosquito Coast of Central America to England, with the news that one of the native kings there had given him 30,000 km2 of land! The land was incredibly fertile, the natives helpful, and he'd already established an army, banks, civil service AND democracy there. You couldn't walk without tripping on the gold nuggets that littered the ground, and MacGregor was selling land grants at a very reasonable rate!!</line>
				<line>You're describing the FICTIONAL nation of Poyais, T-Rex! That was a huge scam!</line>
				<line>It - what?</line>
				<line>When the colony boats arrived, instead of opera houses they found untamed jungle, tropical disease and venomous snakes. One settler even committed suicide after trading his life savings for passage. By the time a rescue boat was sent and returned to London, 180 of the 240 emigrants had DIED.</line>
				<line>SEE T-REX THIS IS WHY I KEEP SAYING YOU SHOULD FINISH YOUR BOOKS BEFORE TELLING YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT THEM</line>
				<line>It wasn't a book!!</line>
				<line>It was a WIKIPEDIA PAGE that got BORING half-way through.</line>

				<line>As a gentleman who is not afraid to say what we're all thinking, I'm going to say what we're all thinking.</line>
				<line>Guys! We totally need a new analogy for sex!</line>
				<line>The one we have now is BROKEN. Sex as hunger? Okay, it works with "sexual appetite" and it works in that you want sex, and then you have sex, and then you're like, man, that's all the sex *I* can handle, and then in a little while you start to get the munchies for sex again. But that's it!</line>
				<line>Sounds like a good analogy to me!</line>
				<line>But it's totally not!</line>
				<line>I can die if I don't get any food, but if I don't get any sex, then I just - keep on keepin' on? Also if I'm hungry, I can't lock myself in a room and satisfy my hunger with my own food that's BASICALLY almost as good as the genuine item.</line>
				<line>Food that you produce yourself?</line>
				<line>Food that the Catholic church really doesn't want you eat?</line>

				<line>So we all have to be excited on January 1st?</line>
				<line>No, but it's like - we're aware of it! So it COLOURS the day, and gives us something to look forward to. Every day becomes a holiday! "March 3rd is contentment day!", we'll say. "I hope it comes soon."</line>

				<line>Anyway she woke up as a totally tough dude, stepping on houses like they were toy Monopoly houses, like in the picture? Everyone liked her. But her female form was missing and eventually people thought that she was murdered! Nobody believed her that she was a dude now and they thought maybe HE (the girl) murdered her (herself).

				<line>Utahraptor's comic: Tina Rex was a woman with a curse. Tina Rex was a woman with a very peculiar curse.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor's comic: Ever since she was six, Tina Rex knew that she was one day to wake up as a man!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor's comic: She had been given this curse by her stepmother, who hated her, and presumably men as well. The curse didn't scare Tina. Failing to meet monthly progress reports scared her, missing a checkpoint on her Five-Year Plan scared her, but being a man was like being a woman, she figured, only with more prostate exams. She smiled at her joke. Tina Rex woke up as a man on her 31st birthday.</line>

			<panel>
				<line>I've always been reluctant to get a tattoo, because what if my tastes change? I don't want to be the guy at 50 with "BETTY AND VERONICA 4 LYFE" tattooed on my back. I mean, right now I kinda do, but I can see that changing in like two seconds.</line>
				<line>But I've come up with a solution!</line>
				<line>The whole problem comes from the fact that tattoos can't be altered, but that's not true! For example, imagine I get a tattoo of a butterfly, and THEN, I realize I wish I'd gotten a tattoo of a flexing guy with guns for eyes instead. All is not lost! I just get a tattoo of a flexing guy using his gun eyes to SHOOT the butterfly, and I'm the coolest! I instantly become the coolest dude.</line>
				<line>So each new tattoo shoots the old one, but what happens when you run out of space?</line>
				<line>Well!</line>
				<line>I acknowledge I have finite room on my body for "the tats", but I don't think I'm THAT indecisive. Anyway, once I have the Enterprise shooting Batman shooting gun eyes shooting a butterfly, I think I'll be happy. I just - I can't ever see regretting that.</line>

				<line>Guys, I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but, well, here we are. I should just say it.</line>
				<line>Bingo is totally suboptimal and inefficient!</line>
				<line>Check it out: replace the caller with a computer, and you make the bingo numbers get called like a billion times faster. Replace the bingo players with other computers, and you speed up the rate at which the game is played. Tie both these innovations together and you can play HUNDREDS of bingo games per second! ONCE AGAIN, something has been made orders of magnitude more efficient by simply replacing all life involved with cold and soulless bingo-playing machines.</line>
				<line>But the fun thing of bingo is in dabbing the numbers, in building up suspense as the game progresses. You've made it boring!</line>
				<line>Nope!</line>
				<line>My new, hyper-efficient bingo is basically like putting in your money, pressing a button, and being informed whether or not you've won.</line>
				<line>Exactly!</line>
				<line>But that's what slot machines do, and people LINE UP to play them! OH SNAP! IS THIS ANOTHER ARGUMENT WON BY T-REX??</line>

				<line>It turns out there are some regions where my HyperBingo(tm) is played. Neat!</line>
				<line>And it's all thanks to legal loopholes!</line>
				<line>AS IT HAPPENS, in some areas gambling is heavily regulated, but bingo is a special case that isn't. And so companies have built electronic bingo machines, exactly as I envisioned! Whats more, some have used bingo as an engine to power other types of gambling, like poker and slot machines. The game plays a hidden bingo game, and if you get a bingo, your slots will ALWAYS come up as three cherries. It's nuts! Bingo's being used in ways GOD NEVER INTENDED.</line>
				<line>But how do they translate bingo into poker? You have choice over what cards stay in your hand!</line>
				<line>They CHEAT!</line>
				<line>Say you got a quick bingo, and that translates into a royal flush. You're doomed to win! If you throw away all your cards, you're just gonna get dealt the same flush in a new suit. Even if you try to lose, the computer will step in and CHANGE YOUR CARDS, or just make you win the next game.</line>
				<line>Insane!</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus! Which creature goes on four feet in the morning, two feet at noon, and three feet in the evening?</line>
				<line>Its a human, T-Rex. Babies crawl on all fours, then they walk around and then when they're old they use a cane. Come on, that riddle's from Ancient Greece. That riddle is so old-school, the techniques necessary for modern school construction won't be invented for two thousand years.</line>
				<line>Huh! People know the riddle of the Sphinx?</line>
				<line>You're surprised?</line>
				<line>T-Rex, it's most likely the oldest riddle on the planet. Without hyperbole, entire civilizations have risen and fallen since someone first came up with that riddle. IT predates PAPER.</line>
				<line>Well... Patrick Stewart liked it.</line>
				<line>EARLIER:</line>
				<line>Patrick Stewart: T-Rex, your riddle spoke to me personally because I started today on four feet, managed to walk on two feet at noon, and now I'm using three feet!</line>

				<line>It's the wedding experience! You get some single people together who think life is a race, and then you convince them THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF WEDDING that the only way to avoid coming in dead last is to get married! The result: hookups!</line>
				<line>Hookups of the ill-advised nature!!</line>
				<line>Come on, T-Rex, that's just a stupid stereotype and lame soap opera trope!</line>
				<line>Lame and SEXY</line>
				<line>I just think that if you go into this wedding evaluating all the guests by their hookup potential, it'll colour your wedding experience in a really weird way.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor, guess what?</line>
				<line>What?</line>
				<line>I'm still totally gonna be on the lookout for bad hookups!!</line>
				<line>AT THE WEDDING.</line>
				<line>Voice: So what are you thinking, baby? Yes or no?</line>
				<line>Um, I'm thinking... That a lot of my internal conflict and malaise comes from the tensions between the life I ACTUALLY want to live, and the stories I'd love to be able to tell?</line>

				<line>I am a man who, when he is at an all-you-can-eat restaurant, will restrict what he eats based on his peers. I don't know when to stop, so I rely on the verbal and non-verbal cues of my dining mates to tell me when I'm full!</line>
				<line>I call this condition "Appetite Asperger's"!</line>
				<line>It is a hilarious AND excellent name because people with Appetite Asperger's analyze the behaviour of others while eating and come up with a ruleset for saying when they're full. Just like someone with real Asperger's! Only, instead of applying this to social interaction, I apply it exclusively to knowing when to say "Wow, dudes, I'm full! How about you guys, huh? Pretty full? Oh my gosh, me too!"</line>
				<line>I would've thought you'd call it "T-Rex's condition" or something!</line>
				<line>NORMALLY, I would have!</line>
				<line>But I made a list and I've already got like four or five T-Rex's conditions. Plus, Appetite Asperger's has assonance going for it!</line>
				<line>I suppose. I'm still not comfortable with the name!</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Wow, that was a terrible movie. Definitely one of the top 50 worst films ever!</line>
				<line>T-REX THERE IS BARELY 100 YEARS OF FILM SO THAT'S NOT SAYING MUCH</line>
				<line>A FILM 1000 YEARS FROM NOW BEING ON THAT LIST NOW THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING</line>
				<line>Ridiculous!</line>
				<line>There's still bad movies. Anyway, most "Worst Book Ever" lists have mainly modern entries despite THOUSANDS of years of book history.</line>
				<line>Yeah, because most ancient texts are lost forever! I'd bet less than 10% of movies are lost and I'm sure more than that amount of text is gone.</line>
				<line>How are you measuring volume? Sure ANCIENT books are lost, but we generate so much text today that it's probably a tiny percentage overall!</line>
				<line>you have to include web sites, emails, spam...</line>
				<line>You're seriously comparing email to film?</line>
				<line>Well!</line>
				<line>Come on! If you're including spam as text, are you including webcams as film? What about security camera footage, stored and erased without ever being watched? And how are we defining worst? Personal taste? Objective value? Box office performance, ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION OF BOTH MONEY, POPULATION, AND BOX OFFICES?</line>
				<line>ONE WEEK LATER:</line>
				<line>What a terrible movie THAT was. I'd definitely rate it one of the Top 50 Worst Films Of All Time!*</line>

		<title>the pebble was actually found in an australopithecine cave, so it may have been discarded before the dude died, left behind, untouched and alone and forgotten for millions of years. QUESTION: IS THIS VERSION OF EVENTS MORE OR LESS MAUDLIN</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>So, SOMETIMES, archeologists find things that don't belong in their geological contexts: shells where there were no oceans, that sort of thing. And there's lots of explanations like "maybe an animal ate it and pooped it out, GROSS."</line>
				<line>But sometimes these objects are found with human remains!</line>
				<line>And when that happens they call it a manuport: something that was carried by hand by ancient dead dudes. Manuports are neat because they show you what ancient dead dudes found interesting! And the most awesome manuport is the oldest one, called the Makapansgat pebble. It dates to 3 million years ago!</line>
				<line>There weren't humans around to carry it 3 million years ago, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>Nope!</line>
				<line>But there were PROTOHUMANS. Australopithecines! And the Makapansgat pebble has this natural "eye eye mouth" face shape on it. A protohuman had enough curiosity and aesthetic sense, 3 MILLION YEARS AGO, to see the face in the rock, and thought it was special enough to carry around with him until he died.</line>
				<line>I think it's beautiful and amazing that millions of years later, another human being dug up the same pebble, recognized the same face, and maybe even for a moment, dreamed the same dreams.</line>
				<line>You stepped on a human being back there.</line>
				<line>That's - um, that's beautiful too?</line>

				<line>DINOSAUR COMICS ASKS: IF YOU COULD LOSE ANY SENSE, WHAT WOULD IT BE?</line>
				<line>Me sense of proprioception!</line>
				<line>That's the sense that lets you know where your body parts are at any given time!</line>
				<line>And it's ALSO a sense that gets dulled when you drink, which is why you have trouble touching your nose with your eyes closed in such situations. You're forced to rely on proprioception, and with it dulled, you miss! You poke out your eye with your hand or whatever.</line>
				<line>Proprioception!</line>
				<line>And you really want to be CONSISTENTLY SURPRISED about where your limbs are when you can't see them?</line>
				<line>Maybe!</line>
				<line>You know what? I don't think you would! I think you ACTUALLY chose proprioception because it's not one of the classical five senses, and you wanted to be Mr. "Look At Me Guys I Chose An Unexpected Answer".</line>
				<line>Oh, it's true! But I messed up. I'd really prefer losing nociception: the sense of pain!</line>
				<line>BUT THAT IS A LIE TOO!</line>
				<line>Voice: T-Rex, I'm afraid this accident has robbed you of one of your senses: the sense of what's appropriate in a given social situation!</line>

				<line>Well, why wouldn't you warn us?</line>

				<line>Time for a funny joke, everyone!  Alright?  Alright.</line>
				<line>Okay, so this man gets into a car accident and wraps his car around a telephone pole!</line>
				<line>And there's this passer-by who is, um, passing by, and he happens to see it.  He rushes over to the crumpled car and says "Oh my God, are you okay??" and the guy says "Well, I get by!"</line>
				<line>... I don't get it.</line>
				<line>The driver misunderstands the question; he thinks it's about whether or not he makes enough money to "get by" in today's difficult world!</line>
				<line>But nobody says "Oh my God, are you okay??" to mean "Oh my God, do you have a sufficient salary??"</line>
				<line>Sure they do!</line>
				<line>No they don't!  They lock eyes with you and say "Are you doing alright?" with a hand on your shoulder or something.  Honestly, this joke seems like it could have been funny at some point, but you telephone gamed it in your head and it doesn't make sense anymore.</line>
				<line>EARLIER:</line>
				<line>Passerby: So he rushes over and puts a hand on the guy's shoulder and says "Oh my God, are you okay?  Are you doing alright?" and the guy says "I make a comfortable living!"</line>

				<line>It is common to imagine your life as a story, with yourself as a main character! It's a story with no real climax that always ends with you totally dead.</line>
				<line>However!</line>
				<line>My issue is that STUFF happens to main characters: dramatic stuff! Stuff that's not always good. It would be fun to be a bit character, a guy who gets one or two lines and whose personality is encapsulated in a few words: 'likes boats', 'old and wise', or 'eats a lot and, therefore, can't control himself around food. When someone says, "Where's the beef?" he runs up and says, "Did someone say BEEF?" because that is definitely how people who like food act.'</line>
				<line>Then I was thinking, maybe I am that!</line>
				<line>But you've said WAY more than two lines,my friend!</line>
				<line>Yeah, but it's Rosencratz and Guildenstern, right? I've got my own life, but it only counts when I'm around the main character. Everything else is forgotten!</line>
				<line>so who's the main character?</line>

				<line>"Ho, there," came a cry from across the boulevard. "Quite a smashing hat you've got there!" It was the thunder-lizard's friend, another thunder-lizard.</line>
				<line>"It's the latest in fashions for thunder-lizards," said the thunder-lizard. "It fits my crown perfectly!" </line>

				<line>What will science be like in the year 65,000,000?  Friends!  I am here to tell you: many amazing advances will be made!</line>
				<line>Think of how far we've come in just the past one hundred years!</line>
				<line>And the pace of innovation is only accelerating.  Consider that iPods from only five years ago are now LUDICROUSLY UNACCEPTABLE, when in history a person might own a single record player their entire lives!  It is certain that in the year 65,000,000 marvels dwarfing even branded consumer electronics await us.  What new and fundamental discoveries about the universe are ahead?  Will our personal holographic media players ALSO accept phone calls??</line>
				<line>I believe they may not!</line>
				<line>Explain!</line>
				<line>I mean only to suggest that the uninterrupted progress of the past century could in fact BE interrupted, perhaps by a planet-wide and biblically awesome catastrophe SO HUGE that intelligent life is forced to re-evolve from scratch.  In the year 65,000,000 we may just be catching up to where we are now!</line>

				<line>And since it's Hallowe'en, the prize is NOT ONLY a date with me (T-Rex!) but it's a HELLA CREEPY date with me (T-Rex!). I'll arrive two hours early, stand perfectly still across the street, and peer into your window with binoculars. I'll ring the doorbell while pressing my eye up against the peephole. I'll ask you how your day was and whenever you use the pronoun "I" I'll suck my fingers. I will be only MODERATELY discreet about it. Happy Hallowe'en!</line>
				<line>And people will bid on you why?</line>
				<line>Because of charity! It's all for charity, my good man!</line>
				<line>I feel like I'd prefer to give my money to charity directly, rather than go through this whole "creepy date" thing.</line>
				<line>Well, alright, then I guess I'll just end up dating someone who WANTS a hella creepy date with a stranger!</line>
				<line>HALLOWE'EN NIGHT:</line>

				<line>It was insane. I never get road rage, bicycle or otherwise, and I never flip anyone off! But here I was being all that I hate! I flipped him off without even looking behind, and THEN, after I flipped him off he honked at me again, two little ones, and I flipped him off again, two little ones. Then I turned left and got away!</line>

				<line>Agreed!</line>
				<line>So let's just multiply everyone's vote by their informedness!</line>
				<line>Making a less informed vote worth less?</line>

				<line>Today is a good day I think...</line>
				<line>...for a treasure hunt!</line>
				<line>Sweet! So what are we looking for, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>Okay so in 1958 these two US Air Force planes were doing training exercises with a real nuclear bomb for some reason, and they crashed into each other! And one of the planes was so damaged that it had to jettison its bomb above a bay in Georgia!</line>
				<line>We're searching for a nuclear bomb!?</line>
				<line>Serial number 47782, baby!</line>
				<line>This bomb was missing its nuclear capsule though, T-Rex! It wouldn't explode.</line>
				<line>Aw man! NEVERMIND.</line>
				<line>Yeah, where you REALLY want to look is beneath the ice in Greenland. Another crash there had four nuclear weapons involved, but only debris from three was recovered. There was evidence the fourth - or parts of it - had been so heated by the resulting fire that it melted down through the ice. Serial number 78252!</line>
				<line>T-REX LISTEN I CHECKED AND NOTHING GOOD CAN POSSIBLY COME FROM YOU HAVING ACCESS TO A NUCLEAR WEAPON</line>
				<line>Perhaps you missed the scenario in which I use it to blow up... pollution?</line>

				<line>"EUPHEMISMS" FOR DATING</line>
				<line>Yes!  Maybe sometimes you don't want to throw the fact that you've found happiness in the arms of another in my face?  Maybe you need some "euphemisms".</line>
				<line>For example!</line>
				<line>Instead of saying "Sally and I are now dating exclusively" you can say "Sally and I are now seeing other people ONLY WITH REGRET."  On second thought, maybe you should keep the "Sally and I are now dating exclusively" because if I don't want to acknowledge your commitment, I can play dumb and say, "Sally and you are now dating exclusively... axe murderers?  Mad scientists?  Um, DOGS?"</line>
				<line>So, hey, your euphemisms are pretty weak so far!</line>
				<line>Yes.  Allow me to correct that!</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>THE MYTH OF KING MIDAS</line>
				<line>Midas was a king who was nice to a friend of the God of Wine, and so he gets a wish from the God of Wine! NICE! And so Midas wishes that everything he touched would turn to gold.</line>
				<line>Instantly the ground he's standing on transforms into gold!</line>
				<line>The gold change races across the planet's surface and down into the mantle like a shockwave, transmuting it instantly. In seconds, the Earth's iron-nickel core becomes pure non-ferrous gold, and the planet's magnetic field is lost. Unshielded from solar wind, every living creature begins to absorb desperately fatal levels of radiation. The soft gold of the planetary crust is unable to sustain the weight placed upon it, and begins to buckle and distort.</line>
				<line>Midas watches in horror as his planet dies a golden death!</line>
				<line>But not for long!</line>
				<line>He's soon overcome by the terrible sensation of drowning on dry land: any air that touches his lungs is being transmuted on contact into tiny flecks of gold. He suffocates and dies as his lungs fill with the formerly precious metal.</line>
				<line>Air that touches his cooling body continues to transmute, and he's soon covered in a fine golden layer of ash.</line>
				<line>The moral is not to make wishes like that, King Midas!!</line>

				<line>So gravity happens because matter bends spacetime and blah blah blah.  But dudes, I had a crazy idea!  What if instead of gravity being a property of matter, it was a property of the ENTIRE FRIGGIN' UNIVERSE?</line>
				<line>Have all minds within the sound of my voice been COMPLETELY AND IRREVOCABLY BLOWN??</line>
				<line>So check it: the universe is suffused with tiny invisible particles that travel in equal intensity from all directions.  So if you were alone in the universe, you'd be hit equally from all directions and nothing would happen.  But if there's a planet in front of you, then any particles coming from its direction are going to hit it instead and not you!  So you're no longer in balance, and particles coming from BEHIND you will push you towards the planet.</line>
				<line>And YOU'RE blocking a much smaller number of particles from hitting the planet, so it'll move a little towards you!</line>
				<line>Yes!</line>
				<line>It's a fun theory, but if you're absorbing particles all the time, shouldn't you be gaining mass?</line>
				<line>No, because they're "#8212; massless?</line>
				<line>Ah, so you'd be absorbing energy then.</line>
				<line>They're "#8212; energyless as well?</line>

				<line>Okay so this game is called "Guess Two Thirds of the Average"! We all pick a number between 0 and 100 and guess what 2/3rds of the average of everyone else's guesses will be!</line>
				<line>The winner is the person who guesses the closest number!</line>
				<line>So let's say everyone else chose 100 - you'd want to choose 66.67, because that's 2/3rds of 100. But the catch is you all choose your numbers at the same time and don't tell the other players.</line>
				<line>So, 66.67 is really the ceiling - any number larger than that can't possibly win!</line>
				<line>Exactly!</line>
				<line>But I can assume all the other players know this too, and won't guess higher than 66.67.</line>
				<line>Yep!</line>
				<line>So in that case I should choose 2/3rds of THAT, which is - 44.44?</line>
				<line>But assuming the other players know that too...</line>
				<line>...then I keep taking 2/3rds off that number until I end up at 0.</line>

But why are these pleasures just related to reproduction? Why can't I have the joy of having a child without actually HAVING to have the child?</line>
				<line>It's my understanding that children are really expensive, you guys!!</line>
				<line>I don't see what kind of shortcut, you're going for here!</line>
				<line>Genetic Engineering! It's SO EASY.</line>
				<line>let's just replace the biological imperative to reproduce! Let's give ourselves the same joy and wonder from an egg sammich as we get from first holding our child in our arms! Let's make gum as deeply fulfilling as watching your child graduate top of the class, Dean's list, summa cum laude. Bubblegum flavour.</line>
				<line>So your ideal future is one where everyone's weeping over their Whoppers with Cheese, and nobody's having sex?</line>

				<line>I am a generous guy!  If someone wants to go in front of me in traffic, I slow down and let them in.</line>
				<line>But it's all an act!</line>
				<line>I let someone cut in front of me for two reasons: because I figure this way it's more likely they'll do the same for me in the future, and because I recognize that it helps the traffic system as a whole.  But this isn't generosity, it's greed!  It's well-presented greed.  It's me selfishly wanting to get around quickly so BADLY that I'll sacrifice the short term for the long term.</line>
				<line>So you think you're not actually a good person!</line>
				<line>I'm not!</line>
				<line>I'll ask if you want the last piece of pie before I take it, but again: that's just me selfishly wanting friends and knowing that actually showing my greediness impedes that.  Otherwise I'd be gobbling it like crazy!</line>
				<line>Well, even if it's an act, at least you're pretending!  Tons of folks won't even do that.</line>
				<line>That's true!  And... and that means as long as they're still around, then I'm NOT the worst person ever!  Oh my God, now I have a perfectly selfish reason to be thankful for all the jerks!</line>

				<line>Yep!</line>
				<line>It's not that hard, you guys!</line>
				<line>Someone comes in and says "Boo hoo I have trouble with one or more of my RELATIONSHIPS", and what do I say? I say "How does that make you feel?" and they say "Sad" and I say "But talking about it makes you feel better, right?" and they say "A little, I guess" and I say "Excellent! CASE CLOSED."</line>
				<line>When I say "Case closed" I make eye contact, take off my glasses, and dramatically slam closed the book I'm holding.</line>
				<line>You don't wear glasses!</line>
				<line>I wear them when I'm a relationship counsellor, silly!</line>
				<line>This whole thing is so implausible! How did you suddenly become a counsellor? Where do your customers come from?</line>

				<line>It doesn't matter if you were losing when they kicked the bucket: you've still won with the best finishing move possible! And what's more, your victory is SO AWESOME that it completely overshadows everything your opponent ever accomplished during his life! People will say, "Sure, that guy may have CURED CANCER, but he lost so badly at chess that he died." EVERY VERSION OF HIS OBITUARY WILL END WITH "CHECKMATE."</line>
				<line>Every time we play chess, you're hoping that I die!!</line>
				<line>I'm not!</line>
				<line>Okay, I am. But it's a small hope!</line>
				<line>Yeah, a small hope I'll be dead and gone and remembered as "The Guy Who Was So Upset When He Lost His Queen That His Heart Stopped Beating"!</line>

				<line>What is love? Love is "a strong positive emotion of regard and affection". It was a silly question to ask because the answer is right there in the dictionary!</line>
				<line>But that's too easy. We have to complicate up that business!</line>
				<line>Maybe we'll insist that love can't be defined, that it's beyond the reach of rational thought, that we fall in and out of love in a way that is completely beyond our control. All we can do is hope for the best and hold on for the ride, because it's Cupid's arrow straight through the heart, striking anywhere at any time! It's a lot like an axe murderer, or a brain aneurysm. Or a stroke. Or dementia.</line>
				<line>Love is just a feeling! A CHEMICAL STATE. We don't need to deify it!</line>
				<line>So romantic!</line>
				<line>I've got nothing against romance! You can still be romantic while maintaining that love is an understandable emotion. Just be rational! And don't do tons of stupid stuff and use "I was in love!" as the justification. That's not love: that's responsibility deflection.</line>
				<line>A voice outside the picture: So you're completely rational about love? You keep any non-sciency feelings out of it, walking around town saying "this person is acceptable; I will proceed to love them. Love begins in 3, 2, 1, - now."</line>

				<line>So it turns out that there's different kinds of love.</line>
				<line>I know! Who knew?</line>
				<line>There's ROMANTIC LOVE, but there's also the love you feel for a family member, an activity, religious love, a sandwich, and so on. And we call all these "love", which maybe is why people are so confused about it! What we need are DIFFERENT words for each of these feelings.</line>
				<line>Like other languages!</line>
				<line>Aw man! Other languages already stole my idea?</line>
				<line>Long ago, actually! Ancient Greek had words for passionate love (eros), dispassionate love (philia), the love of family (storge), general affection (agape), and so on. Versions of these survive in modern Greek as well!</line>
				<line>Aha, but still no sandwich love!</line>
				<line>EVERY DAY EACH OF US SAYS THE DUMBEST THING WE ARE GOING TO SAY THAT DAY.</line>
				<line>Hey, maybe the ancient Greeks all died out and evolved into current Greeks PRECISELY BECAUSE they didn't have a word for "sandwich love"??</line>

				<line>I am a fan of knowing things!  Generally, the more things you know, the better prepared you are for someone asking "Hey, do you know all about 18th century literature?"</line>
				<line>Because then if you know about 18th century literature you can punch them aside and say "OBVIOUSLY!"</line>
				<line>But it occurs to me there are situations where ignorance is bliss!  For example, imagine if you knew all about how the worst moment of your life would go down.  You'd spend a bunch of your time saying "Aw dang, that's STILL going to suck!"</line>
				<line>Or maybe you'd say "I'm glad my current circumstances aren't as bad as THAT!" or "Now that THAT'S over, things have nowhere to go but up!"</line>
				<line>True.  Okay, but say you knew the BEST moment of your life!</line>
				<line>Something to look forward to!</line>
				<line>Okay, but say it's passed, so it's all downhill from here on out.</line>

				<line>And then?</line>
				<line>And then... he dies of a heart attack!</line>
				<line>But like, 50 years later, you know? Long after he's come to terms with everything. The vast bulk of the book details Billy's entire adult life, and the last page says "The actual title this book is 'Mr. Bill Peterson, Who Came To Terms with His Life Over 60 Years'".</line>

				<line>If I were an employer and I had two equally qualified candidates, but one resume came from colin@businesssuccessislifesuccess.com and the other resume came from colin@chumpstakingdumps.com, I know which one I'd want to hire!</line>
				<line>Is it colin@chumpstakingdumps.com?</line>
				<line>It is without hesitation!</line>
				<line>That business success jerk has the most obnoxious email address ever.</line>
				<line>And the other guy doesn't?</line>
				<line>No man! The other guy surveyed the field of resume email addresses and said, "You know what? It can be done better." I'm fascinated by him! Who is Colin? And furthermore, what of his Chumps, who it seems are presently Taking Dumps?? I don't know, but I want to offer him a job to find out!</line>
				<line>T-REX PUTS UP A FAKE JOB LISTING TO SEE WHAT EMAIL ADDRESSES HE GETS. THE BEST IS FROM COLIN@BONERSAPOPPIN.NET</line>
				<line>Hah hah! Awesome!</line>
				<line>... It's not the guy I made up, though.</line>

				<line>TWEETING.</line>
				<line>Okay, I get that you're using Twitter! SUPER. But I really don't get why we need a new verb for that.. All "tweeting" means is "posting to Twitter": it's got the same meaning as "post", except THIS verb can only be used in relation to a single corporate website. That's insane! Corporations invent nouns all the time, and I can accept that, but verbs? Really? Is updating Twitter SO DIFFERENT than updating any other website that we need a whole new word for it?</line>
				<line>Man this is old news, Professor Curmudgeonly! You ever seen something escalate?</line>
				<line>Sure have!</line>
				<line>OH DAMN "ESCALATE" IS A VERB MADE UP FROM "ESCALATOR", WHICH WAS ITSELF A TRADEMARK! So now you can't escalate. And you also can't zip up your pants. Or go trampolining, roller-blading, or jetskiing. Or tase your enemies.</line>

				<line>Okay, so I've been down on poems in the past. I MAY have been heard to remark "Guys, poetry bloetries." But I've just discovered:</line>
				<line>Poems likely predate the written word!</line>
				<line>It makes sense when you think about it. Before writing, the only way to keep track of something is to memorize it! And if you're memorizing something in POEM form, then you can automatically incorporate structure to the language: say, rhyming couplets. And that structure gives you something to jog your memory if you forget! The result is that structured narrative poetry can be much easier to remember than just free verse.</line>
				<line>So poems could be among the earliest, most practical forms of communication!</line>
				<line>Yes!</line>
				<line>And this is why I feel bad! I didn't know that I was making fun of one of the Elder Gods of language! I thought I was making fun of "The smelly dog who pooed / Has spied me in the nude".</line>

			<panel>
				<line>Conceptual metaphors are those that allow us to understand one idea in terms of another! They inform the language we use when talking about all sorts of concepts, and are almost subconscious.</line>
				<line>For example: "LIFE IS A JOURNEY"!</line>
				<line>People use this metaphor all the time, all talkin' about "going places in life," "getting a head start in life," "being at a crossroads," and so on. It's so entrenched that to talk about life using another metaphor seems odd! For example, saying "I've saved $3.55 in life" sounds weird, but only because I'm using the much less popular "LIFE IS A DISCOUNT STORE WITH SALES THAT CAN OCCASIONALLY BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF" metaphor.</line>
				<line>Are there other metaphors like this?</line>
				<line>Oh, tons!</line>
				<line>"Burning with desire and "warming up to someone"? That's "AFFECTION IS HEAT." "Falling behind" at work before "catching up"? "SCHEDULES ARE MOVING OBJECTS." "You're in my way," "Get out of my way," and, ARGUABLY, "I've lost my way"? That's the classic "DIRECTION IS A BUCKET THAT PEOPLE KEEP SNEAKING INTO."</line>
				<line>In conclusion, cognitive linguists love conceptual metaphors because they allow us to describe direction as an intensely desirable giant bucket.</line>

This algorithm allows you to grow your network of friends in much the same way that ANY NUMBER of deadly diseases reproduce!</line>
				<line>You need a seed friend, though!</line>
				<line>True!</line>
				<line>And that brings us to method one: online dating!</line>
				<line>But that results in spouses, not buddies!</line>
				<line>Not NECESSARILY: Look up profiles, find someone interesting and date 'em, and then say that you "just want to be friends"! Kapow: INSTANT FRIENDSHIP THAT'LL LAST A LIFETIME.</line>
				<line>Friendship, founded on deceit and romantic frustration.</line>
				<line>No deceit with me, baby! I use the lines sincerely!</line>
				<line>If I just want to be friends, I just want to be friends! And if I'm saying "It's not you, it's me", then I'm also saying. "Frig, man, I've got to go pull myself together! I'm dropping the ball here, and it's REALLY not fair to you."</line>

				<line>HERE ARE SOME FACTS ABOUT ST. PATRICK'S DAY!</line>
				<line>Did you know that St. Patrick used to be associated with the color BLUE?</line>
				<line>It's true! You travel back in time to the 1200s and you say "What color goes with St. Patrick?" and they'll answer "blue"! Eventually. First you'll need to figure out how to communicate with the people there: their vowels will sound all crazy to your ears. Plus, assuming you're in an English speaking part of the world- and there were a lot fewer of them then- the language was way more Germanic than what you're used to.</line>
				<line>You're right in the middle of Middle English, my friend!</line>
				<line>And it was really fragmented back then!</line>
				<line>The British will end up creating a Standard English just to ensure that government communication can be READ outside of London.</line>
				<line>But not until the 1400s, so if you're in the 1200s and nobody understands you, you could always wander around, find another dialect group, and try again!</line>
				<line>Anyway yeah now St. Patrick's color is green</line>

				<line>It's not that hard to be creative!  But sometimes when I come up with a joke, I find out it's already been invented in the past, and it's always by the same dead guy!  I now have a beef with this dead person.  You'd best watch out...</line>
				<line>...OSCAR WILDE!</line>
				<line>Man, Oscar!  Here's a guy who's been taking the credit for TONS of great jokes that I would have come up with if he hadn't done so first.  Telling a border guard "I have nothing to declare except my genius"?  I TOTALLY WOULD'VE COME UP WITH THAT IF IT HAD NOT ALREADY BEEN COME UP WITH.  "I'm not young enough to know everything"?  THAT PROBABLY WOULD'VE BEEN MY BON MOT.  Wilde's the most egregious preemptive plagiarizer of my funny jokes ever!</line>
				<line>You're not mad at Oscar Wilde, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>Pretty sure I am, Utahraptor!</line>
				<line>No, you're mad at J. M. "Peter Pan" Barrie for the young one, and at some anonymous wag for the genius one - nobody's found a reliable link to Oscar for it.  He just gets the credit!</line>
				<line>Huh.  Okay, I'LL be the guy who's mad at all the UNWARRANTED credit Wilde gets, then.</line>
				<line>"If with the literate I am/ Impelled to try an epigram,/ I never seek to take the credit; / We all assume that Oscar said it." - Dorothy Parker.</line>
				<line>FRIG.</line>

				<line>What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger!</line>
				<line>Is that... medicine?</line>
				<line>I know it doesn't work in all cases, or maybe even MOST cases, but it works with vaccination, right? A weaker version of the disease teaches your body to fight the real deal.  So what I'm wondering is if I ate something disgusting, does that, you know... level me up for some REALLY insanely disgusting things in the future?</line>
				<line>You mean in terms of protection against disease, or in terms of adjusting your taste?</line>
				<line>Both, I guess!</line>

				<line>There were some dead moths in my cereal this morning, and I'm hoping there's some way I can turn this into a positive event.</line>

				<line>Attention, please, everyone! I've done some reading about the brain and I discovered there's a part of it called the "amygdala"!</line>
				<line>And the amygdala is responsible for FEAR RESPONSE!</line>
				<line>This is amazing! I had NO IDEA fear was localized to a single location. This opens up whole new avenues in the field of toughening up the very scareable: just open up their brain and remove their amygdala, and it's an instant fearectomy! They'll wake up from surgery, shake your hand, laugh in the face of danger, and then get business cards that say "PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO EXPERIENCE FEAR".</line>
				<line>That's like solving a problem of high blood pressure by removing the heart, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>Only analogously!</line>
				<line>The amygdala doesn't just do fear, anyway: it's also responsible for long-term memory rentention! The more emotional the memory, the better it's stored. If you lose it you also lose the ability to learn from feelings!</line>
				<line>Hah! NOT A PROBLEM. You know all I've ever learnt from feelings?</line>

				<line>A MAN WALKS INTO A BAR explained</line>
				<line>many jokes begin with this line. It is called the "set-up", and is analogous to establishing-shots in films or first paragraphs in essays.</line>
				<line>It alerts the audience that what follows is likely to be a short story with a humorous climax!</line>
				<line>What is the attraction to this structure of humor? Why are there so many jokes about men walking into bars?</line>
				<line>Part of the attraction to this structure may be its possibilities: most anything can happen in a bar, especially if this bar is contained within the wild and wooly world of the verbal jest.</line>
				<line>What about the joke, "A man walks into a bar...ouch!"?</line>
				<line>Good question!</line>
				<line>The joke assumes some sophistication on the part of the audience, an expectation gleamed from previous jokes that the bar is a drinking establishment.</line>
				<line>Go on!</line>
				<line>The "ouch" is startling. How could entering a bar hurt? It forces us to now re-evaluate our most basic assumptions.</line>
				<line>We must ask ourselves, "What if the bar were a bar proper, and by walking into it the man actually, physically walked into it?"</line>
				<line>It is this confusion on the part of the listener that is responsible for the humor!</line>

There's tons of mental illnesses where we can't find any reason for them to be happening and have no idea what's causing them. NOBODY KNOWS WHAT CAUSES SCHIZOPHRENIA. You can just wake up one day and say, oh damn dudes, I've got schizophrenia! HOW IS THAT NOT TERRIFYING?</line>
				<line>Physical diseases are like that too, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>What? No they're not!</line>
				<line>Yeah, any disease can have an idiopathic version, meaning for all intents and purposes that it arises spontaneously, with no detectable physical cause. All we can do is shrug and try to treat the symptoms!</line>

				<line>Millions of years of evolution were all leading up to that one amazing moment of your birth!  Billions of individuals - entire SPECIES - had risen and fallen, all conspiring together to produce one thing: you!</line>
				<line>... Then you went ahead and lost any specialness from that a second later when someone else was born.  Nice one.</line>
				<line>But you're also special for what you know: information that's recorded nowhere else in the Universe!</line>
				<line>Yes!</line>
				<line>What idle, passing notions briefly entertained you before falling asleep last night?  What snack did you sneak last week?  All this information is known by only one person in the entire universe: YOU.</line>
				<line>And you consider this information so irrelevant that you forgot it almost as soon as it was known.</line>
				<line>Untold volumes of information have been forgotten by you!  As they fade unnoticed from your memory, so too do they fade from the Universe.  Each future generation has been robbed of this knowledge, expunging it, as you have, completely from existence.</line>

				<line>Once upon a time there was this really great cereal. It was oats in the shape of an "o", sweetened, and inside the "o"s there were clusters of tasty nuts.</line>
				<line>It was SO good!</line>
				<line>And then they took the cereal off the market and this little kid could never find it again. Okay, it was me. I was the kid. I looked and looked and was convinced all the grocery stores were hiding it somewhere. But it was gone, and that one box of the cereal was all I ever had. I never stopped looking, however, and yesterday I found it - under a different name, but with all the same ingredients!</line>
				<line>And? How was it?</line>
				<line>WAY too sweet, Utahraptor.</line>
				<line>It wasn't too my taste at ALL. And the kicker is I remembered it as being even sweeter! I realized that my tastes had changed long ago - that I'd never again be able to enjoy the cereal I remembered so vividly. I'd been chasing a dream that had somehow become impossible when I wasn't looking.</line>
				<line>And for who? For a child I knew decades ago, a child who had long since faded into adulthood - into me. Anyway bottom line I had to see food go to waste so I poured the rest through your mail slot.</line>

				<line>THE MYTH OF ICARUS</line>
				<line>Icarus and his dad were imprisoned on an island with water patrols, so they couldn't escape by boat. But they still wanted to escape anyway, so they made wings out of wax and feathers and flew away.</line>
				<line>Pretty clever, boys!!</line>
				<line>And while they were flying, his dad warned Icarus not to fly too close to the sun, because the wax in his wings would melt and he'd fall to his death! Icarus said "Frig, is this symbolic of how we mortals should not aspire to usurp the power of the Gods? Is this an allegory showing the limits and folly of earthly invention? Because we just invented heavier-than-air flight out of WAX and FEATHERS, Dad. I think maybe the Gods won't mind."</line>
				<line>And then Icarus flew straight up!</line>
				<line>As high as he could!</line>
				<line>And as saying that things get hotter the higher up you get is incredibly naive (how come mountain tops aren't sweltering?), Icarus was fine. Temperature actually DECREASES as you go up the troposphere, and there's no way Icarus could fly up to the thermosphere, where things DO get hot, because there's just not enough air.</line>
				<line>So Icarus had a great time flying and when he finally landed his dad said "Wow, I sure was wrong", and they spent the rest of their lives flying just as close to the sun as their clever mechanical wings would take them. Kids! The moral is never listen to your elders!!</line>

Will!!  Die!!!  The bullet sped closer."</line>
				<line>Yeah, but Spider-Man never dies!</line>

				<line>Some people think pornography is bad, since when they see it they get offended and say "That's way too explicit. SHEESH!" With that in mind, I've come up with something special: pornography for them! But it's also -</line>
				<line>Pornography for everyone!</line>
				<line>Obviously, you can't control how explicit images are, since they're set. But, you CAN control how explicit text it, since any images there are imagined by the reader. So all you need to do is craft sexy fiction that relies on the reader generating any eroticism in the scene! That way, they only have themselves to blame if they imagine something they think is way too sexy.</line>
				<line>I'd like to see an example!</line>
				<line>Of course!</line>
				<line>Pat and Alex had some sort of relationship. One time they were expressing it physically - in a remarkable way! Their location: erotic. Upon seeing it a third party would likely say "How are they... wow. Just - wow."</line>
				<line>That's not very erotic.</line>
				<line>You criticize only your own imagination!</line>
				<line>Did you even NOTICE how I used names that work for both men and women? It is QUANTUM EROTICA, at once straight, lesbian, gay and other, which only collapses into one sexuality upon being observed by the reader!</line>
				<line>Honestly! Sometimes I wonder how I'm not more famous!</line>

But Lord Britishface III says "Here is a man who will wear a monocle in his old age; surprise him, it may pop out comedically. He takes his tea by the Hamptonshire while reminiscing of the summers of his youth." And these expectations are set up not only in others, but in the child himself!</line>

				<line>Excellent. Then it's settled!</line>

				<line>The amount needed to heat one kilogram of water by one degree Celcius. And the suggested diet has a daily calorie level of around 2000.</line>

				<line>Celsius is way better than Fahrenheit! Celsius puts zero at the point where water freezes, and 100 at the point where it boils. That's handy! Water's EVERYWHERE, man.</line>
				<line>If you're ever trapped in the past you can recreate Celsius, no problem!</line>
				<line>But Fahrenheit? FAHRENHEIT is based on the temperature of brine for zero and the temperature of some eponymous dude's armpit for - 96 degrees? They should've called it "Armpits! The Temperature Scale".</line>
				<line>Fahrenheit DOES ensure there's no negative numbers when dealing with commonly-encountered temperatures.</line>
				<line>Oh, boo hoo! So does Kelvin, and that's BASICALLY Celsius anyway!</line>
				<line>I think all this underscores how arbitrary these systems of measurement are!</line>
				<line>What? How?</line>
				<line>You're always just picking two temperatures and dividing the space between up into arbitrary degrees! We could just as easily be dealing with the freezing and boiling points of a 50/50 mixture of champagne and caviar, say.</line>

				<line>OKAY YEAH PROBABLY BUT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU EQUATE MANLINESS WITH POLYAMORY AND I FIND THAT REALLY INTERESTING</line>
				<line>Oh, with high fives standing in for sex? It's not THAT interesting. Our culture equates virility with manliness, and so, hey presto, someone who can get more people pregnant is manlier!  It's super dumb because getting someone pregnant isn't difficult!  People do it accidentally ALL THE TIME.</line>
				<line>I really don't see this "pregnancies induced equals manliness" connection!</line>
				<line>Really?</line>
				<line>Yes really. I don't see the paragon of manhood as being able to successfully deliver sperm to the most eggs.  It's a very literally biological view of manliness, you know?  I think we as a gender can aim higher. </line>

				<line>Today I glanced at an idiot driver as I passed him to confirm my suspicion.  He was elderly.</line>
				<line>Figures!</line>
				<line>Old people are the worst drivers.</line>
				<line>T-Rex I've heard you say that about every possible demographic - whether it's age, gender, or race.</line>
				<line>They all suck!</line>
				<line>But you said you were confirming an initial suspicion.</line>
				<line>Yeah. That he sucked.</line>
				<line>So really you're suspecting bad drivers of being not you.</line>
				<line>And it is always true.</line>
				<line>The same suspicion also applies to ugly people!</line>

				<line>Panel 1.1</line>
				<line>Let's play a type of "Choose Your Own Adventure" where the path of the story is dictated by how fast you read. Ready... set... go! On to the next panel!!!</line>
				<line>Panel 1.2</line>
				<line>Ok, if you're reading this path, it means you were spacing out for a long time and didn't start reading until now. Or you were camping out here for a while. In which case, congrats! Secret story path!!!</line>
				<line>Panel 2.1</line>
				<line>Wow, you got here fast! You either skipped ahead, or camped a while. I admire your patience... or lack thereof.</line>
				<line>Panel 2.2</line>
				<line>But not too fast. It's not a race or anything. Just read at your own pace.</line>
				<line>Panel 2.3</line>
				<line>You sure took your sweet time getting here! That's ok, we'll take the leisurely route. Suits me just fine.</line>
				<line>Panel 2.4</line>
				<line>YOU HAVE BEEN SLAIN BY AN UNRULY PACK OF BABOONS. YOU WIN!</line>
				<line>Panel 3.1</line>
				<line>Does anything of substance happen in this story? Or do we just humor the reader as he or she fumbles through the novelty of this storytelling device?</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus. What is an adventure but a fumbling through novelty? And through such rites of passage, are there not guides along the way to "humor" the initiate?</line>
				<line>Panel 3.2</line>
				<line>So by "Choose Your Own", you mean have the narrative thrust at you haphazardly in accordance with your natural reading pace?</line>
				<line>YES!</line>
				<line>So no choice at all then, unless you want to awkwardly modify your reading habits.</line>
				<line>But aren't all our "choices" bound by our personal limitations anyway?</line>
				<line>Looks like you win that argument!</line>
				<line>Panel 3.3</line>
				<line>When I start reading a panel and it changes suddenly, I feel like I am being punished for not reading fast enough.</line>
				<line>Punished? No. REWARDED. With a tantalizing glimpse of a story path you are not yet meant to behold!</line>
				<line>Panel 3.4</line>
				<line>Seriously, would anyone take this long to get to this panel?</line>
				<line>These are fertile camping grounds my friend.</line>
				<line>Panel 4.1</line>
				<line>I SEE PROBLEMS WITH THIS!</line>
				<line>Panel 4.2</line>
				<line>Hold the phone!!!</line>
				<line>Panel 4.3</line>
				<line>I think my head is starting to hurt!</line>
				<line>Panel 4.4</line>
				<line>Man, I don't know about this!</line>
				<line>Panel 4.5: </line>
				<line>This is the crazy version of this panel where we have no disagreement and there are no problems.</line>
				<line>Tra-la-la.</line>
				<line>Panel 5.1:</line>
				<line>I fail to grasp the objection you may or may not have voiced in the previous panel. </line>
				<line>OH WHERE DO I EVEN BEGIN.</line>
				<line>Well, I suppose we could just leave it at that in this story path. </line>
				<line>YOU GOT IT.</line>
				<line>Panel 5.2</line>
				<line>What's all this now?? </line>
				<line>For starters, have you noticed sometimes while you're in the middle of reading a sentence, the panel suddenly changes?</line>
				<line>Why yes. What of it?</line>
				<line>IT'S AWFUL.</line>
				<line>IT'S ADVENTUROUS.</line>
				<line>Panel 5.3</line>
				<line>Um, say what???????</line>
				<line>Ok, let me explain. Unlike a typical CYOA with pages that set up different story branches with some detail, these shifting panels have us fly by the seat of our pants! Each one has to be generic to fit whatever preceded it.</line>
				<line>So??</line>
				<line>Panel 5.4</line>
				<line>WH-WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAahem. As I was about to say before that panel shift. Utahraptor, so what if the panels fit a generic mold to suit any preceding event? Other CYOAs work that way too. You either get killed by a shark... or maybe a lion!!!</line>
				<line>YOU CAN'T DO THAT.</line>
				<line>Panel 5.5</line>
				<line>Do what?</line>
				<line>YOU CAN'T DO WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW. That is, continue a conversation from the same panel after it just switched. That panel was a separate story path! It's like two people in different dimensions talking to each other!!!</line>
				<line>WHOA, AWESOME</line>
				<line>Panel 5.6</line>
				<line>NO, NOT AWESOME.</line>
				<line>I don't see what the big deal is. We're having a nice chat.</line>
				<line>But people just entering this panel have no idea what we're talking about.</line>
				<line>Those rae some slow readers. Anyway, they can find out, by camping!</line>
				<line>Panel 5.7</line>
				<line>But that is not in the spirit of this storytelling model! Man, look, this whole thing is unhinged now. You totally broke the CYOA format you invented. Happy?</line>
				<line>I didn't invent it! I am merely the excitable spokesman for the concept presently.</line>
				<line>Panel 6.1</line>
				<line>Thanks for reading! If all went well, you will have spent way too long looking at this image, and are now feeling a little dizzy!</line>
				<line>Together, we made this adventure an extraordinary success!!!</line>
				<line>Panel 6.2</line>
				<line>Thanks for reading! If all went well, you will have spent way too long looking at this image, and are now feeling a little dizzy!</line>
				<line>Together, we made this adventure an extraordinary failure!!!</line>

		<title>this works for a bunch of other sayings too!  "if the shoe fits, die in front of your tv set", "those who cannot remember the past are condemned to die in front of their tv sets", "elvis has left the building, so we should all just die in front of our tv</title>
		<body>

				<line>You know what? FINE. I'll be the guy they find dead in front of his TV ten years later. It actually sounds kinda awesome, and as the saying goes, "If you can't beat 'em, then you might as well die alone in front of a television set"!</line>
				<line>Pretty sure that's how the saying goes!</line>
				<line>How are you going to pull this off, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>It's surprisingly easy! Automatic payments for rent and utilities, a timer to turn the lights and TV on and off each day, and a robot vacuum that'll push any new mail away from my mail slot so it won't pile up! And my neighbours won't miss me, because I'll tell them this is but one of the MANY homes I keep.</line>
				<line>Okay, but what about emails and other online communication?</line>
				<line>No problem!</line>
				<line>I'll be OLD, Utahraptor. The Eliza bot I'll hook up to my email should be at least as lucid as I'll be by then! People will get her responses and say "Huh! T-Rex sure has gotten good at responding to certain key phrases in my emails!"</line>
				<line>I already say that.</line>
				<line>Super!</line>
				<line>LATER: TESTING OUT THE ELIZA BOT!</line>
				<line>Alright! "T-Rex, how are you? From Utahraptor."</line>
				<line>Eliza Bot: "UTAHRAPTOR IT HAS BEEN TOO LONG. I AM DEFINITELY STILL ALIVE. LOL. IS YOUR MOTHER STILL WORKING AT THE LIBRARY?"</line>

				<line>Looks like you dropped the ball, NLP researchers!!</line>
				<line>T-Rex- Because MY email autoresponder takes in text with all sorts of imperfect and rreguar language, disambiguates word sense, builds a semantic understanding AND generates an appropriate response in the time it would take a real person to type it out. Oh snap! Did a rank amateur, wanting only to ensure that his body wouldn't be discovered for a few years after he died, just brutally advance the state of the art? SEEMS LIKE IT BABY!</line>
				<line>So how's it work?</line>
				<line>TiRex: Just fine, thank you!</line>
				<line>No, I mean, how'd you do it, how did you figure ut the semantics and word senses? Statistical methods? But those have problems with recall and precision, even with - are you using the web as a corpus? How are you handling the noise?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor, please! So many questions!</line>
				<line>I just wrote "Email Responder TWO THOUSAND" on a giant novelty chef's hat, taped a page from the dictionary to it, and then stuffed the whole deal into my computer's CD tray!</line>

				<line>Yeah, but we're not in a story, plus your AI only answers emails!</line>
				<line>So?!</line>
				<line>I'll tell you what's gonna happen: AIs will happily take over email, sending replies that eventually only other AIs will respond to. Released from the shackles of responding to email, we'll become decadent, fat and complacent. We'll DIE OFF, Utahraptor.</line>

The Byzantines used it to gain an advantage in all sorts of wars, and they kept it such a secret that eventually they forgot how to make it too. Awesome! Damascus steel was SO STRONG that people claimed its swords cut through other swords - but the technique used to make it is lost, and the raw materials used are long gone. OH WELL!!</line>

Ooh, or like Cary Grant! I could sound like the platonic form of charming, suave, unreliable and debonair MANHOOD.</line>
				<line>Have you tried faking it?</line>

				<line>It's confusing and disappointing.</line>

				<line>This seems pretty reasonable.  But it can't possibly be the case!  If you take me, I've got two parents.  My parents have two parents themselves, so this means that three generations ago, four people are needed to eventually produce me.  Another generation back, we're eight people, and five generations ago gives me sixteen ancestors!</line>
				<line>And if you go back 1500 years or so, say, fifty-five generations?</line>
				<line>That's exactly the problem!</line>
				<line>At fifty-five generations, I've got over TEN QUADRILLION grandparents all running around at the same time!  Man!  There's NO WAY there was room for that.</line>
				<line>Ah, but you're assuming everyone's sexing up a totally genetic stranger.  If you sex up a relative, any child produced will have fewer grandparents!</line>
				<line>...Huh!  So the fact that there weren't ten quadrillion people 1500 years ago SCIENTIFICALLY PROVES that some of my ancestors liked sexing it up with their cousins!!</line>

				<line>AHA MY FRIEND BUT WHEN PRECISELY DID IT SWITCH FROM HEAP TO NON-HEAP</line>
				<line>I dunno!  At some fuzzy point if would switch for most observers from "heap" to, say, "small pile", and there we can draw the line.  Language isn't that precise.</line>

				<line>YOU NEED TO HAVE YOUR MIND BLOWN NOW OKAY</line>
				<line>Sounds kinda dumb to to me!</line>
				<line>What does?</line>
				<line>The point at which a shrinking heap of sand becomes a non-heap.  Clearly I'm supposed to struggle with an arbitrary threshold, because piles on either side of it look much the same.  But it's just language!  Look at statistical usage of the word "heap", decide using that average, end of story.</line>
				<line>Oh snap, philosophers!  Did T-Rex just totally school you with statistically-based descriptivist approach to semantics?  IT APPEARS THAT HE TOTALLY DID!!  It also appears he's speaking in the third person because he's so impressed with his awesome self!</line>

				<line>In the 1300's, the regular chicks and dudes in England were speaking what we'd call "Middle English", a rapidly developing alternative to the Latin and French used in religion and government.</line>
				<line>It was an exciting time to be saying "Forsooth"!</line>
				<line>And some of these dudes were big into English being developed as a "real" language, particularly one John Wycliffe, who decided to translate the Bible - one of, if not THE most important book of his time - into casual English. This would allow John's less educated countrymen to read it since, as it'd been written in Latin since the 5th century, currently required either formal education or a priest to interpret it for you!</line>
				<line>But when they started translating, they ran onto some problems!</line>
				<line>Papal Resistance?</line>
				<line>That, but also a lot of English words they needed didn't exist yet! So John invented them, and we still use his "behemoth", "puberty", and "zeal". But he also needed a word for intestines", and the phrase he came up with - FOR THE BIBLE, I REMIND YOU - was "arse ropes".</line>

		<title>my friends, i just had an imagination that demands my full attention</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Yesterday I saw one of those mugs with a super cute drawing of a bear on it with the text "Good friends make life BEARABLE." Adorable!</line>
				<line>Only I didn't immediately notice the bear!</line>
				<line>And the "BEAR" part of "BEARable" wasn't capitalized. So my impression was simply of a mug with black text stating "Good friends make life bearable". It was this amazing mug of depression, a mug that broadcast to all who can read that life is pain, nothing but pain, that life will kill you and that only good friends can make it even briefly sustainable.</line>
				<line>Let's sell them!</line>
				<line>I know, right?</line>
				<line>People are done with mugs that say cute things like "I Hate Mondays" or "World's Best Dad". We want realist mugs! Mugs that say things like "Maybe Mondays Aren't The Problem; Maybe I'm The Problem."</line>
				<line>"I've Realized: Other Dads Are Almost Certainly Better."</line>
				<line>Oh man! Can you imagine a secretary drinking coffee out of an "Is This All There Is?" mug?</line>
				<line>I can!</line>
				<line>[[T-Rex imagines tiny Batman head on left talking to tiny Spider-man head on right]]</line>
				<line>Batman: You can be my new roommate, Spider-man. I GUESS.</line>

				<line>Man, I totally missed out on my window for skydiving. I should've done it when I was younger!</line>
				<line>I had WAY less to lose then!</line>
				<line>What do you mean, T-Rex? A catastrophic dive in either case and you're still dead.</line>
				<line>True, but if I die at, say, 50, that's 50 years of accumulated experience, knowledge and responsibility that die with me! But if I die at 16 then all the world loses is one wacky teen and one handful of pages of wacky teen fan fiction.</line>
				<line>But at 16 you had way more potential than you would at 50!</line>
				<line>Ouch!</line>
				<line>At 16 you've got the potential for both you at 50 and the potential for trillions of alternate future and alternate yous, possibilities which are trimmed each instant you're alive. At 50 you've already exhausted tons of your options!</line>
				<line>.... Interesting.</line>
				<line>You know, life's funny, Utahraptor. I woke up this morning convinced that it would be better to die in a skydiving accident at 16 than at 50. Now I don't know what to believe!</line>
				<line>That's funny?</line>

				<line>Maybe it's a good idea that people don't live forever. Rhetorical people, I mean!</line>
				<line>Like me and my dinosaur friends!</line>
				<line>If everyone lived forever, then there'd still be folks alive today who feel PERSONALLY AGGRIEVED by the ancient Koban culture, or who hold true to their born belief that the Earth rightfully belongs to, I dunno -  the Visigoths? We'd never get anything done because we'd all be bickering over ancient wrongs, real or imagined. If we can't forgive, death at least gives us the option to forget!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: coming out strongly in favour of death?</line>
				<line>Apparently!!</line>
				<line>Obviously I'd rather have an alive grandparent than a dead one, but I can see the advantage at the societal level in not having folks with mores thousands of years out of date still rinning around!</line>
				<line>I suppose 3000 years ago there were people who DID hate the Kobans!</line>
				<line>Exactly! And now they're all dead, and the Kobans are dead, and we can all go through life without dealing with their irrelevant racism. </line>

		<title>a more accurate line would be "Well-established trails for riding a horse along? Where we're going, we don't need... well-established trails for riding a horse along."; either will be enough to concede the point.</title>

			<panel>
				<line>How come there wasn't science fiction a thousand years ago? I gotta say...</line>
				<line>The serfs certainly dropped the ball on that one!</line>
				<line>It's weird, isn't it, Dromiceiomimus? I don't see any reason why past dudes couldn't have written stories about what life would be like down the road. Why couldn't they have imagined horses that, when ridden fast enough,  travelled back through time and allowed you to sass up your parents?</line>
				<line>Maybe they were too busy trying to survive?</line>
				<line>Or maybe you're just being narrow in your definition of science fiction!</line>
				<line>Explain!</line>
				<line>Okay, well, nobody was talking about flying cars, sure, but people did conceptualize Pegasus, and that's a friggin' flying horse. Horses being the cars of olden times, remember? Just because Peggy didn't have a scientific underpinning doesn't mean he wasn't the result of people imagining better technologies!</line>
				<line>Okay, that's a good point. However! I will not concede until at least ONE ancient manuscript is uncovered that includes the line "Hay? where we're going, we don't need... hay." And then the horseman has to flip down the visor of his armour, okay?</line>

			<panel>
				<line>Yep!</line>
				<line>Pretty sure I just ate some spider eggs!!</line>
				<line>There were gross red egg-sac things at the bottom of my drink, Dromiceiomimus! And I thought "Gross" and then I said "At least I didn't consume any of them though!" and then I forgot about how you should never say things like that because then I found some sacs stuck between my teeth too.</line>
				<line>Gross!</line>
				<line>I KNOW</line>
				<line>You can either be optimistic or pessimistic about this, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>Today, my friend, I choose pessimism!</line>
				<line>Maybe THESE are the spiders who thrive on stomach acid! Maybe in a week I'll be vomiting up millions of tiny red spiders, over and over again. And maybe that won't be enough, and the rest will eat their way out, tunneling through my stomach, muscles, and finally, skin.</line>
				<line>Gah!</line>
				<line>LATER:</line>
				<line>Pessimists say that by expecting the worst, they're pleasantly surprised when things don't go that badly! I thought I'd give it a try, but honestly... </line>

		<title>A.F.S. said the only reason life is APPARENTLY thriving is because nature doesn't want the death of an individual to end things forever.  With enough life running around and eating other life, you can have tons more misery to go around AND avoid the dange</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Man, speaking of pessimism, you know who's pessimistic?</line>
				<line>Arthur Friggin' Schopenhauer!</line>
				<line>Not only did A.F.S. not believe that this is the best of all possible worlds, he supplied a proof that this is, in fact, the WORST of all possible worlds! First he assumed that the worst possible world would be sustainable, since if it ended, nobody would be around to suffer. Prolonged suffering across millenia beats instant death!</line>
				<line>Clearly!</line>
				<line>CLEARLY.</line>
				<line>Then he observed that our world is good enough to support life, but just barely!</line>
				<line>Life's everywhere, man!</line>
				<line>Sure, but one small shift in orbit, a slight change in temperature, and it's a catastrophe on a global scale. There's no wiggle room; if our fragile world was only a little worse there would be no life on it at all!</line>
				<line>Therefore ours is the worst of all possible worlds?</line>
				<line>Yep! Because any worse and it wouldn't be a world, it would just be an empty planet without suffering, and nature ABHORS an empty planet without suffering.</line>
				<line>Anyway!</line>
				<line>I believe it was after this proof that A.F.S. added the "Friggin'" to his name!</line>

				<line>LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS</line>
				<line>today's technique: LEITWORTSTIL</line>
				<line>Today is a good day I think for leitwortstil!</line>
				<line>Leitwortstil is the purposeful repetition of words or phrases in a story, you guys!</line>
				<line>For example, a dog might always be described as "that wacky jerk" in a story, to underline what a wacky jerk that dog turned out to be. Or in a collection of stories, the same phrase might appear in each story, which helps tie them together as a whole! Leitwortstil ALSO happens when a character says the same word over and over and over again.</line>
				<line>You mean like a catch phrase?</line>
				<line>Sure!</line>
				<line>I'm not sure that counts as leitwortstil, does it? If it's just someone saying "Gee golly jeepers!", and there's no theme or motif associated with it - then it's just there for laughs, isn't it?</line>
				<line>My friend, I believe you are unfortunately TOTES WRONG on this one!</line>

				<line>I'm not afraid to admit it: I've nurtured some talents and have become particularly good at certain things.</line>
				<line>For example: stomping on things!</line>
				<line>I am really good at stomping on things. Years of practice have enabled me to put my foot above an object, shift my weight to the foot with force, and thus compress whatever is beneath my foot. And should I see someone struggling with stomping, something SO HARD for them and yet so easy for me, I would gladly help them out!</line>
				<line>Assuming they want it, of course.</line>
				<line>Of course!</line>

				<line>At the top is SELF ACTUALIZATION, which sounds pretty great, right? Except you can't get there unless you've already satisfied the level beneath it, which is esteem.

		<title>dollar auctions were invented by martin shubik, okay, so listen, mr. shubik, i like your name</title>

				<line>Dollars for sale! DOLLARS FOR SALE!</line>
				<line>Dollars for sale, you guys!</line>
				<line>Dollars for sale in an auction where everyone pays their highest bid, whether or not they win!</line>
				<line>So when you bid 1 cent, Dromiceiomimus - FOR A PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE DOLLAR - you'll be getting a great deal and you'll make a profit of 99 cents! But watch out, because if Utahraptor outbids you with 2 cents, then you could lose your penny!  Remember you have to pay your high bid either way.</line>
				<line>So it's in my interest to outbid him with 3 cents: that way I can at least make a profit of 97 cents!</line>
				<line>But then I'll just outbid her with the exact same motivation!</line>
				<line>True!</line>
				<line>But then - if Dromiceiomimus bids 98 cents, I'll bid 99.  Then she has to decide whether to bid $1: if she doesn't, she loses 98 cents, but if she does, she'll break even.  So she does, and I'm left with the choice of either losing my 99 cents, or of bidding $1.01 and then only losing 1 cent.</line>
				<line>So I bid more than the dollar is worth, just to minimize my losses!  And it keeps on going, and we both end up bankrupt!  This is the worst ever auction, and I'm not bidding.</line>
				<line>Would you say... "The only winning move is not to play?"</line>
				<line>No, I think that movie's been referenced enough lately</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus, just recently this dude was found dead with shards of glass in his heart! You know what happened? His new lava lamp was taking TOO FRIGGIN' LONG to warm up, so he put it on his stove and heated it, and it got too hot and exploded on him and he died.</line>
				<line>Whoah! That's terrible.</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus, did you hear that if you have a bird tattoo, it means that you're big into hugs? Giving, receiving, watching, it's all good to you!</line>
				<line>Really! Why the bird?</line>
				<line>It stands for "I will flip the bird RIGHT NOW to anyone who doesn't like hugs; I'm not even joking."</line>
				<line>Interesting! And also true!</line>
				<line>I heard that tattoos with the letter "h" in them...</line>
				<line>...Yes?</line>
				<line>Well, I heard that an "h" in any tattoo is short for "Hey, Ask Me About My Sexual History", and a second "h" on the body is short for "Hey, Some Of It Is Personal Though, Okay?"</line>
				<line>And a third "h"?</line>
				<line>"Hooray for the Huxtables."</line>
				<line>NOTE FOR FUTURE PEOPLE WHO COME ACROSS THIS COMIC:</line>
				<line>The Huxtables were a family on a TV show. TV is what we had before we got video in our brains! And everyone who read this comic when it first came out was really great, even if we're all dead now.</line>

				<line>Today is a good day, I think, for a guest comic.</line>
				<line>I'm in a comic!?</line>
				<line>It appears that by informing me of my current existence within a medium of entertainment, the guest comic author has already broken the so-called "fourth wall".</line>
				<line>Why should that matter?  Your existence now is in no way different than it was before.</line>
				<line>but as a character in a comic, I am required to be a source of entertainment.  This is a demand that I have up to now been unaware of. Thus I must provide the reader with some semblance of comedic banter... perhaps a pun using the phrase "breaking the fourth wall" and my current action of crushing many walls.</line>
				<line>I believe that particular point would have been better off remaining a subtle irony.</line>
				<line>Since I do not have a joke readily available, I will just have to resort to entertainment through violence. </line>
				<line>But you don't NEED to come up with a joke or rely on entertaining violence!</line>
				<line>How so?</line>
				<line>As a character in a comic, you have no true free will of your own.  Nor do you think at all! It is the author that will com up with the joke.</line>
				<line>But what if he forgets to come up with a funny punchline?  If I have no free will, does that mean that I will be forced to just take up space in the last caption and say nothing at all?</line>
				<line>If the author is a lazy bum, yes.</line>
				<line>I don't see a punchline!</line>
				<line>Just say "who the hell goes to Cornwall"</line>
				<line>Seriously, who does that?</line>

				<line>David Hilbert was a mathematician and hotelier who was born in 1892.  He built an infinite hotel, you guys!</line>
				<line>THE INFINITE HOTEL</line>
				<line>A TRUE STORY</line>
				<line>So Hilbert built this infinite hotel that was infinitely big and had infinitely many rooms; I believe this was a matter of some investment.  But build it he did, and soon after a bus with infinity people in it showed up, with each of them wanting a room!  Lucky for Hilbert he had his infinite hotel, so each guest got a room, and the hotel was filled up to capacity.  Nice!  But just then another friggin' bus showed up, and it ALSO had infinity people in it!</line>
				<line>Nobody builds for TWO infinite buses showing up right after the other!</line>
				<line>Turns out they do!</line>
				<line>He just told every guest already there to move into the room that was double their current room number.  So the guest in room 3 moved into room 6, and so on!  Thus, only the even-numbered rooms were occupied, and everyone on the new bus could have an odd-numbered room!</line>
				<line>Amazing!</line>
				<line>Yep!  Anyway!</line>
				<line>It's my understanding that he died an infinitely rich man infinity years later</line>

				<line>Hah!  Whoops!</line>

				<line>But they can also be entirely free from any quasi-insulting Latinate etymology the other words have.  There's people trying to reclaim these currently-taboo words in the same way "queer" was!</line>
				<line>Neat!  But largely irrelevant to us, as our reproduction is not through vaginal intercourse!</line>

				<line>The words for "mother" and "father" are really similar, if not identical, across tons of languages! And the reason isn't because the languages are closely related. It's due to a way more awesome reason! </line>
				<line>It's because parents totally assume their babies are talking about them! </line>
				<line>It's so amazing: "ma", "pa" are some of the first and easiest language-like sounds babbling babies make - and what's the word for "mother" in English? "Mama"! And it's also "mama" in Dutch, and in Romanian, and in Catalan, Slovak, Quechu, Romanian, Chinese, German, Russian, and MORE. The languages have evolved such that the first language noise a baby makes sounds like it's saying "Hey mom, what's up?"</line>
				<line>And dads make the seam deal too! "Papa" is in English, Cree, and Hindi! </line>
				<line>Neat!</line>
				<line>It's kinda awesome that these words are built to flatter new parents.</line>
				<line>Man, it's great! Across language, time, and entire civilizations, we're united by pointing at our babbling babies and saying, "Yes. This child is DEFINITELY talking about me."</line>

They will have learnt their lesson." But I wrote down some cusses last night and nothing bad happened!</line>

				<line>Morris: oh i'm fine, t-rex, it's very nice of you to ask</line>
				<line>Morris: only to tell you the truth i'm not all that fine because i've been under a lot of stress lately!</line>
				<line>Stress?!</line>
				<line>Morris: oh, gosh, yes, i didn't even think things could get so stressful, but then they did! like for example i'm worried about how i'm ever gonna make friends when i get older. when you're just a kid, you've got people in your classes to hang out with and the best part is, every year you've got new classes and that means a heck of a lot of new friends! but when you're an adult you've got a job instead of class, and people don't normally change jobs every year from what i've seen, so maybe i'm wrong but it seems like if your old friends move away and you're not friends with the folks at work, then it might be awful hard to make new friends!</line>
				<line>Aww, Morris, that's nothing you have to worry about now!</line>
				<line>Yeah, you won't have to deal with that until you're way older!</line>
				<line>Morris: but doesn't it worry you fellas to have problems waiting for you like that?</line>
				<line>Morris: if i have a problem, my parents and role models always tell me that it's best to face it head on, rather than ignoring it and hoping it'll get better all on its own! because sometimes, that doesn't happen, and then you've got an even bigger problem to deal with! and that's just the worst</line>
				<line>Well, that's right, but if you ever find yourself in this situation, you can just join a club or a team and meet new people that way!</line>
				<line>Morris: shucks utahraptor, that's awful good advice, but wouldn't you end up liking your free time but then feeling bad taht you have to spend the biggest part of your day with folks that aren't even your friends? and it really doesn't seem like you're allowed to ask how friendly folks are during a job interview</line>

				<line>Ours is an imperfect world, and as such there's no perfect dudes in it. All the dudes we have are imperfect instances - copies, if you will- of the ideal dude, who is so great he can't even EXIST.</line>

				<line>It's DEFINITELY time for me to fix the great works of fiction!</line>
				<line>The great out-of-copyright works of fiction, anyway. My brilliant idea is to completely recontextualize them through the magic of framing stories! So for example, instead of Moby Dick being about this guy after a whale, it's this CRAZY SCIENTIST writing whaler fan fiction, and at the end, the scientist stops and says "Sheesh, I didn't mean to write so much whaler fan fiction."</line>
				<line>And Moby Dick takes place in the middle?</line>
				<line>Exactly!</line>
				<line>And Pride and Prejudice is still this fancy romance story, but now it's framed by this dude being asked to describe the ultimate video game, and at the end the dude says "Anyway after that it becomes a turned-based strategy game with a focus on resource management".</line>
				<line>...Huh.</line>
				<line>Hamlet ends as it normally does, but then the framing play starts up again and it's Hamlet's dad looking into a crystal ball, and he says "Forsooth, now let's see what would happen if I won the lottery!!"</line>

				<line>Wow! I guess we need to know how much our planet is worth, then. I'm guessing... a kabazillion dollars?</line>
				<line>What if we took the sum value of all the world's currencies? That'd tell us how much everything is worth, in total!</line>
				<line>That works, right? Because money itself isn't worth anything, but we all PRETEND it's worth the value of the goods it's traded for, right?</line>
				<line>Except that doesn't include oceans and stuff - things you can't buy!</line>
				<line>TRUE.</line>
				<line>Plus, buying the WHOLE DANG PLANET means buying everything on it, and that means we now have to put a price on LIFE ITSELF.</line>

				<line>You know what? We totally can put an exact price on life, down to the nearest cent.</line>
				<line>In fact, we do it all the time!</line>
				<line>Every time we land somewhere on the gradient between safety and expense, we do it. If a new ambulance costs $100,000 but would likely save at least 100 lives while it was in use, and we decide NOT to buy it, then we're saying those particular lives aren't worth $1000. Ouch! Sorry, ambulance dudes!</line>
				<line>But maybe we don't have the money to buy an ambulance anyway!</line>
				<line>Sure! It's not a perfect measurement.</line>
				<line>All I'm saying is we ESTIMATE it all the time. Heck, you do it whenever you're paid hourly and you speed into work! Divide the extra money you get by being there sooner by the increase chance of death the added speed brings you, and you've just VALUED YOUR OWN LIFE.</line>
				<line>...I - I guess so!</line>
				<line>On the flip side, whenever housecleaners clean a bathroom, they're PAID to kill the bacteria there! So those tiny lives are worth negative dollars. And there's SO MANY bacteria, Utahraptor!</line>

				<line>Absurdism comics</line>
				<line>woooo</line>
				<line>So! Since the Universe is TOTALLY MEANINGLESS, looking for any sort of meaning in life is absurd, and we're all sorta stuck. But lucky for us, the absurdist philosophers came up with three ways to resolve this! The - the first resolution is suicide.</line>
				<line>I've said it before, but I'll say it again: the absurdists were not the cheeriest potatoes in the bag.</line>
				<line>But if we don't want to kill ourselves, we can find religion, right?</line>
				<line>Right!</line>
				<line>Religion can give hope of a kind and caring world beyond our absurd one. But since they see reason as the greatest tool we've got and religion relies on faith, it's rejected by the absurdists as a (just as deadly!) PHILOSOPHICAL suicide.</line>

Then they get the money.</line>

				<line>It's possible that one day, an advanced civilization (and not necessarily our own!) might be able to reasonably simulate an entire universe, or at least fake it for simulated people living inside.</line>
				<line>And these simulated dudes wouldn't even know they're in a simulation!</line>
				<line>And if a civilization can do this once, it's likely that they'd EVENTUALLY do it more than once. They could even reach a point where simulations are mass produced: billions of disposable toy realities used for experiments, research, or given to children during Future Christmas!</line>
				<line>Sure, maybe in some hyper-advanced future!</line>
				<line>Sure!</line>
				<line>But if we assume that SOMEONE can reach this level, then what's more likely: that WE'RE the ones who develop this technology without actually being in a simulation ourselves, or that we're all stuck in one of the TRILLIONS of simulations being run AS WE SPEAK??</line>

				<line>In MY version, this isn't an allegory or anything. Instead, it's an ALTERNATE HISTORY where Adam and Eve decide not to eat the apple! The entire book of Genesis grinds to a halt at the point where Eve says "Dudes, turns out I'm NOT hungry!"</line>
				<line>Then what happens?</line>
				<line>THEN they cordon off the tree of knowledge to prevent any future mistakes, finally burying it in cement Chernobyl-style!</line>

				<line>They've got nothing else to do there all day, so they invented cement.</line>

				<line>T-REX IN: COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS</line>
				<line>Computational linguistics is the study of computer-based language processing!</line>
				<line>A major area of computational linguistics is that of "ambiguity resolution". It turns out that many things people say in a language - English, for example - can have more than one meaning!</line>
				<line>Consider the phrase "fruit flies like a banana". Is it describing the taste of fruit flies, or rather flying fruit? How can a computer hope to figure this out?</line>
				<line>Many have focused on statistical modelling of language, but this approach is approximate.</line>
				<line>I agree!</line>
				<line>What do YOU know about computational linguistics?</line>

				<line>This marriage has gotten me thinking about monogamy.</line>
				<line>I did some research!</line>
				<line>I found a book called "The Ethical Slut"!</line>
				<line>Basically it gives advice for having loving polygamous relationships. A lot of it makes sense! Like say your girlfriend has a best friend, and they go out one night. You're happy for her, right? You love her, you want her to be happy. So why should that change when you add sex to it? The book also posits that an artificial 'economy of scarcity' in sex leads to jealousy and possessiveness.</line>
				<line>You're saying that because sex is 'rare', it has increased value, and is therefore treasured unreasonably? </line>
				<line>Yeah!</line>
				<line>That's what the book says, anyway. It's not anti-monogamy, but it is pro-polygamy. </line>
				<line>But don't you find that these things don't work in real life? I know I want my partner to be happy, but I also want all of his or her kisses.</line>
				<line>Artificial economy of scarcity, my friend! Like diamonds!</line>

				<line>Where there is lexical or syntactic ambiguity, you could argue that you are free to choose a preferred meaning - granted - but you cannot arbitrarily transform someone's words into what you want!

				<line>I have been thinking about what the Utahraptor said yesterday, and by extension the ambiguity allowable in language!</line>
				<line>Take the Bible, for instance!</line>
				<line>There's a text passed down for hundreds of generations, translated, re-written, re-edited.</line>
				<line>Even if you don't assume that it's the word of God, the difference in meaning between what was written THEN and what you read NOW must be staggering!</line>
				<line>It's often said that the only way to be immortal is through your words and ideas!</line>
				<line>I agree!</line>
				<line>But the Bible shows us that language is mutable!  So what's the solution?  How can I ensure that the ideas I have in my head when I communicate are the same as those you get in yours when you hear me?</line>
				<line>I propose a rigorously defined language without syntactic or lexical ambiguity!</line>
				<line>But how would we write puns in such a language?</line>
				<line>Eh?</line>

				<line>HOW TO MEET NEW PEOPLE</line>
				<line>Meeting new people can be fun!</line>
				<line>It can be tiring if you are meeting a lot of new people at once, however. Here are some tips on how to meet lots of people at once:</line>
				<line>"#8226; Wear something that will identify you and make you easy-to-remember! I recommend a "crazy" scarf or a large disfiguring scar.</line>
				<line>Listen attentively to people's names when you meet them! If their name is the same as yours, laugh!</line>
				<line>I've got one!</line>
				<line>Try to remember interesting stories about yourself. Having such stories close at hand allows you both to fill in awkward gaps in conversation, and also acts to give people a quick, hopefully representative picture of yourself!</line>
				<line>Like when I lost someone's baby!</line>

				<line>COMPRESSED ORIGIN STORY COMICS</line>
				<line>Today's origin story: THE PHRASE "BALLS TO THE WALL"</line>
				<line>Many people assume the origin of this phrase has to do with testicles!</line>
				<line>In fact, it's quite the opposite. The phrase originated with pilots of fighter planes!</line>
				<line>The "balls" in question referred to the knobs on top of the plane's throttle control. When the throttle was at full, the "balls" would be "to the wall" of the cockpit!</line>
				<line>And that's the origin of the phrase "balls to the wall".</line>
				<line>You are incorrect! The phrase comes from olde-fashioned steam-powered trains!</line>
				<line>What?</line>
				<line>It's true! Basically, the engines had two weighted balls, attached to a vertical shaft that was connected to the engine. As the engine speed increased, these two balls would be raised higher because of centrifugal force! At top speed, they would be parallel to the ground, nearly touching the "walls" of the shaft!</line>
				<line>Hence, "balls to the wall"! Man!</line>

				<line>OBJECTIVISM COMICS</line>
				<line>Everyone (including me) is an end in himself: not a means to an end for others!</line>
				<line>This means I should exist for my own sake, neither sacrificing myself to others, nor sacrificing others to myself! The pursuit of my own rational self interest, and happiness, is the highest moral purpose of my life!</line>
				<line>If I must deal with others, it should be as TRADERS, in a pure capitalist system.  No charity! No sympathy! Just business, an exchange of value for value.</line>
				<line>But where does love fit into this system of Objectivism, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>What do you mean?</line>
				<line>Well if everything is viewed as a business arrangement between traders without charity, then how can you have love? Love is selfless.</line>
				<line>Nope! Love is selfISH.  You see value in someone, and they see value in you! You want access to this value, so you arrange a spiritual exchange.</line>

				<line>LOGICAL FALLACY COMICS PRESENTS: </line>
				<line>"THE MIDDLE GROUND"</line>
				<line>This fallacy is when you assume that since a position is between two extremes, it must be right!</line>
				<line>It seems to occur because often, this IS the case.  For instance, eating a moderate amount of food is better than eating to excess, or eating not at all.</line>
				<line>However, just because a case is between two extremes does not make it automatically correct! It must be JUSTIFIED.</line>
				<line>Well, what's an example where the middle ground is not correct?</line>
				<line>Easy!</line>
				<line>Say you think I should go on a trip around the world, while I assure you that I can't afford it and that I should stay home.  From that, we would conclude that I should go on a trip exactly half-way around the world, where I'd probably run out of money and get stuck!</line>
				<line>Sounds good to me!</line>
				<line>Luckily, we have arrived to that conclusion via a fallacy so I will be making no such trip!</line>

				<line>I was asked by a friend of mine how he could tell his sweetheart that he loves her in a new, exciting way! He's worried that he's said the same old thing too often, and that it's getting stale.</line>
				<line>I assured him that there are infinitely-many ways to say "I love you"!</line>
				<line>For instance, you could say "I love you", but you could also say "I really love you"! Or, for that matter: "I really really love you!"</line>
				<line>Therefore, since you can have an arbitrary number of 'really's, there are an infinite number of ways to say "I love you".</line>
				<line>That's not very helpful, is it? You're just adding the same adverb over and over again!</line>
				<line>So?</line>
				<line>So, no woman would sit around while you said "really really really really" for two hours. Anyway, after the third 'really' you move from "emphatic" to "damn creepy"!</line>

				<line>Today I am excited!  Today I did not forget my dentist appointment!</line>
				<line>Today I will be the one to impress my dentist with my personal oral hygiene!</line>
				<line>I spent an hour this morning making sure that my teeth were sparkly clean.  I practiced in the mirror saying "Of course I floss after every meal", "Of course, Doctor!  I floss after every meal", and "Floss after every meal?  Of course!"</line>
				<line>I practiced until I got it RIGHT.</line>
				<line>Well, do you floss after every meal?</line>
				<line>Not hardly!</line>
				<line>But every time I go he asks, and every time I feel like I let him down - personally, you know?  Like he has twenty kids and I'm the only one who doesn't floss and he doesn't know why.</line>
				<line>That's very sad.</line>
				<line>It gets sadder!  Sometimes I imagine he's bought books on how to get your kid to floss, and he's tried everything the books say but still, I don't floss - and he's started to wonder if there is something wrong with HIM.  Has he failed me as a dentist?  As a FATHER?  Where did it all go wrong?</line>

				<line>The secret is to convince your opponent that arguing with you isn't worthwhile!  When they abandon the argument/friendship, you win!</line>
				<line>It's really that easy!</line>

				<line>No!</line>
				<line>I SPECIFICALLY specified that it's for winning arguments/friendships.</line>
				<line>First: Annoying your opponent doesn't mean you've won.  Second:  You can't "win" a friendship.  It's not a competition.  There are no winners or losers.</line>

				<line>The differences between adults and children are many!</line>
				<line>For example: while adults are by definition fully grown, children are much smaller! Adults have more life experiences than children, who may have very little! Adults, legally, are fully-recognized people, while children are not! They do not have the same rights.</line>
				<line>Yes, there are many differences between adults and children!</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus, I would like to reward you for being my friend! What would yo like?</line>
				<line>T-Rex, I didn't become your friend because of the chance of a reward! I'm not sure this is a good idea: people might find it insulting!</line>
				<line>Is that true? Could others take my offer of prizes to be an insult?</line>
				<line>Easily!</line>
				<line>Here's why: it implies that being your friend is somehow deserving of recompense. You insult yourself, but you also insult us, because if we were truly your friends, we wouldn't want prizes! The fact that you are offering them implies you think we'd take them, which implies that you think our friendship is insincere!</line>

				<line>Sept. 6th, 1999: "A new series of fossilized dinosaur tracks was discovered today near Drumheller, in Alberta, Canada. The tracks appear to be those of a fully grown</line>
				<line>Tyrannosaurus Rex</line>
				<line>but paleontologists are confused as to the origin of what appear to be fossilized wood fragments contained within, and scattered just beneath the footprint record.</line>
				<line>These remarkable tracks are joined by those of an adult Utahraptor who apparently stopped and</line>

No matter, I'll shout something clever after him. Turn to panel 5. Forget it! I'm leaving. Escape to panel 3.</line>

				<line>Okay, so here's the plan!  I send cards to all my friends giving them the first clue on a treasure hunt!</line>
				<line>Then, they go on the treasure hunt!</line>
				<line>Each clue leads them to a further clue in a new location, sending them on an across-town adventure!</line>
				<line>The final clue leads them to my house, where they find not only a party with potato chips and barbecued corn, but also the moral that the REAL treasure is friendship!</line>
				<line>(I like all my parties to have morals at the end!)</line>
				<line>Oh boy, this treasure hunt which I have just explained in detail including the twist at the end will be great!</line>
				<line>Agreed!</line>
				<line>And since the Dromiceiomimus and I already know what's going on, we can help!  We should make it a block party, and invite everyone!</line>
				<line>Yeah, like in the fifties!  Everybody was neighbourly in the fifties!</line>
				<line>And all the men wore hats while the women baked pies!  Sure, we had the stability we craved after the turmoil of WWII, but at what cost?  Repression both sexual and sociological left lasting scars, leading in many ways to the cultural self-doubt of the 60s but who cares, we've got to plan this party!</line>

I got in ONE LITTLE FIGHT and my mom got scared, and said</line>
				<line>You're moving with your Auntie and Uncle in Bel-Air!</line>
				<line>I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said "fresh" and it had dice in the mirror!</line>

				<line>For instance, some might say that the destruction of this log cabin violates fundamental principles. But if I were to show that it is a necessary means to a noble end, such arguments are revealed to be petty and ideological!</line>
				<line>Pragmatism!</line>
				<line>But you didn't... oh well, too late.</line>
				<line>Similarly -</line>
				<line>T-Rex, stop! you cannot invoke pragmatism itself as an argument!</line>
				<line>Any pragmatic view must still be rooted in an idea of what's good and desirable. Stating what does and does not "work" is not a moral and philosophical passkey!</line>
				<line>According to your fancy logic, perhaps, but I happen to live in the REAL world.</line>
				<line>Oh, I see. "Questioning everyone's motives but your own" mode today, huh?</line>
				<line>You're just jealous because you didn't think of it first!</line>

				<line>A BRIEF HISTORY OF CHARLES BABBAGE AND HIS WONDERFUL CALCULATING ENGINES COMICS</line>
				<line>Charles Babbage spent a lot of his time working on mechanical calculating engines!</line>
				<line>These were machines that could add and subtract, and later multiply and divide (through repeated addition and subtraction), forecasting in many ways the design of modern-day computers!</line>
				<line>Unfortunately the machines, with thousands of tiny gears and cogs, were too complex, beyond his means to fully manufacture at the time (early 1800s).</line>
				<line>While some see Babbage as the father of modern computers, he had little actual influence!</line>
				<line>Yes, quite right!</line>
				<line>This is because many of the innovations in his Analytical Engine, such as conditional branching and a separation of processing and memory, were left to be re-discovered by a new generation of pioneers!</line>
				<line>Indeed!</line>
				<line>This concludes the brief history of Charles Babbage and his wonderful calculating engines!</line>

		<title>this summer: the earth stops and everybody flies into a wall</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>I have an idea for the ULTIMATE disaster movie: basically, what happens is the Earth stops dead in its orbit one day, and everybody flies into a wall!</line>
				<line>(Or, if they're outside, into the sky!)</line>
				<line>Hah hah!</line>
				<line>Best movie ever!</line>
				<line>So It'd be told in a series of shorts: each short starts a little before everybody flies into a wall, and ends with everybody flying into a wall.</line>
				<line>It would be SO GOOD! You start out small: regular people, a fat guy at a buffet, building up to a parking lot full of cars tumbling into the sky, the star quarterback kicking the ball and then he, and everybody else in the game, flying up after it.</line>
				<line>Your movie sounds awesome!</line>
				<line>I know!</line>
				<line>But wouldn't it get a little repetitive?</line>
				<line>No way! The viewers would know what's going on after the first few shorts, so you play off those expectations. Like, there's this shot of a really elaborate wedding, and the audience is all, "Oh man, all those people are going to fly into a wall SO HARD!"</line>
				<line>And?</line>
				<line>And then we cut to years afterwards, when they're old and stooped, holding hands out on the porch, and THEN the Earth stops in its orbit and they fly off together into the sky!</line>

		<title>the bad news is there's finitely many songs about sad robots</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>I submit that there are a finite number of songs! Therefore, the art of writing music is the art of exploring a closed space of possibility.</line>
				<line>Consider the following!</line>
				<line>There are effective limits on what constitutes music. If we take a week as a very generous upper-bound on the length of one song, then we have a temporal limit. Furthermore, since our ears are not able to distinguish between very similar tones, we do not have a continuum of notes, but rather, a finite set. Therefore, there are only so many songs that can be written!</line>
				<line>I am forced to disagree with you, my friend!</line>
				<line>Surely not!</line>
				<line>I think that you're omitting many dimensions of song. What about the way it's played, the lyrics? These too can be varied almost indefinitely.</line>
				<line>Almost, but there are still effective limits, therefore: finite number of songs!</line>

				<line>Okay, so we covered how everything in a computer is stored in binary code!</line>
				<line>And we covered how any series of binary digits (called bits) can be transformed into a number. But these numbers are really large! They take a long time to send to someone. Luckily, it's possible to send any number, and therefore any file of ANY size, using only two</line>
				<line>single</line>
				<line>bits.</line>
				<line>Sure, all you need are sychronized timers! Send one bit to say 'start counting' and a second to say 'stop!'</line>
				<line>What?</line>
				<line>Yeah! Then all you have to do is count the amount of time between when you got the 'start' and 'end' bits, and that's your number! Transform it into binary code, and you've got your file!</line>

				<line>No, that's wrong. I taught you the dance moves.</line>

				<line>To clarify, I meant to imply that the King of the Dance was self-taught!</line>

				<line>T-REX IN: "PRESENTISM"</line>
				<line>Presentism is when you interpret the historical past with a view from the present!</line>
				<line>Its danger is not just that it is often self-congratulatory, but also that judging historical figures by present-day moral standards is likely not a fruitful line of inquiry. What we see as questionable (say, sexism!) would have seemed completely routine to someone brought up in such a time, and we can't really blame historical figures, I think, for not questioning it!</line>
				<line>This seems awfully close to ethical relativism!</line>
				<line>Huh?</line>
				<line>Well, aren't you saying we can't judge historical figures in a modern context, because they lived their lives during different times? But then what's the point of having our advanced modern ideals, if we can't apply them? I think we SHOULD be able to judge historical figures!</line>
				<line>Anyway! In conclusion, presentism has good points and bad points and is not as interesting as I thought it was!</line>

				<line>HISTORIOGRAPHY COMICS featuring "Good Ol' T-Rex"</line>
				<line>Historiography is the history of history, and includes the study of how history is understood!</line>
				<line>We tend to think that history is just a record of what goes on in the past, but this overlooks the fact that two different people can view the same event, and even the same series of events, differently.</line>
				<line>For instance!  Is history the story of progress, from savage to cultured Man?  Is it rather the study of Great Men and their Characters?  Perhaps it is the story of cultural challenge and response!</line>
				<line>What's with the sexist language, T-Rex?  You're all "great MEN, cultured MEN"!</line>
				<line>Sorry!</line>
				<line>Most of these theories of history are over 50 years old, and reflect the sexism in the language at the time.</line>

				<line>Alright everyone! There's no need for any more haiku: the art form has peaked!</line>
				<line>This is because I've just composed the Perfect Haiku. It has intrigue, a cold night, and perhaps, a hint of gunplay?</line>

				<line>You might want to hold off on that trip for a bit!</line>
				<line>Huh?</line>

				<line>It can be frustrating to live out your life again!</line>
				<line>But - there is hope. Small changes compound into large ones, and soon you will be encountering situations that you don't recall.</line>
				<line>If you're going to impress by making predictions about the immediate future you should do so early on! They may become increasingly inaccurate. </line>
				<line>It can also be difficult to convince people you've traveled from the future!</line>
				<line>Quite so!</line>
				<line>This is why (if you've gone back into your own life far enough) using words and knowledge that are far beyond your means can help impress upon people the truth of your story.</line>
				<line>Be careful though! Overplay this, and you may become separated from your familiar world!</line>

				<line>For instance, after being bit by three tigers, I'd start to generalize that maybe I shouldn't poke tigers, because then they'll bite me.

				<line>Well, there are valid and invalid generalizations, my friend!</line>

				<line>Social Skills Comics</line>
				<line>Social Skills are very important things to have!</line>
				<line>They are what allow us to get along with others, and are the foundation of society!</line>
				<line>With the invention of the "#8220;internet"#8221; and "#8220;email"#8221; and "#8220;instant messaging software"#8221;, people are more social than ever "#8211; and this increased chance for communication leads to better social skills! Hooray!</line>
				<line>Ah, but this electronic communication can take away from face-to-face interaction!</line>
				<line>Doesn"#8217;t matter!</line>
				<line>Actually, it does "#8211; because they"#8217;re not the same thing! Online, if you don"#8217;t like someone, you can ignore them easily and completely. But in real life, you have to talk to people you disagree with or dislike all the time! I"#8217;m worried the skills for dealing with such people will become ATROPHIED.</line>

				<line>Okay!</line>

				<line>So then you've got this small collection of countries that make all the news!  World politics is how these countries relate to one another, and, internally, to themselves.</line>
				<line>That's good, but this definition seems a little unnecessary!</line>
				<line>How so?</line>
				<line>Well, people know what politics are, and "world politics" is just a straightforward application of the adjective.</line>
				<line>Man, you're nerding up the place!  I don't need to hear this talk about "applying adjectives".</line>

				<line>Does "Betty put butter on the bread" mean the same thing as "Betty buttered the bread"?</line>
				<line>I would argue: no!</line>
				<line>In the second example, there is an implication that the bread is wholly buttered, while in the first, this is not necessarily the case! And this applies not just to butter: there are many other examples.  For instance, "Gary wrote for many TV shows" leaves open the possibility of a co-author on the scripts, a possibility that "Gary wrote many TV shows" does not!</line>
				<line>Wow! These small changes in semantics (he meaning of a word or phrase) are quite interesting!</line>
				<line>Yes!</line>

				<line>TODAY'S LECTURE: DISCRETE MATH</line>
				<line>Pay attention, now!</line>
				<line>if you do not like math then skip this comic (seriously)</line>
				<line>The circuit satisfiability problem is determining if there are some inputs that make the outputs of a circuit "true"!</line>
				<line>A closely related problem is the formula satisfiability problem, SAP, which can be mapped one-to-one, and in linear time, to the circuit satisfiability problem.</line>
				<line>So what does this mean?</line>
				<line>If we can solve SAT problems in f(n) time, then circuit-SAT can be solved in 0(n) + f(n) time!</line>
				<line>But circuit-SAT can not be solved quickly.</line>
				<line>Indeed. Therefore, SAT is as "hard" as circuit-SAT.</line>
				<line>Similarly hard problems are "Clique", "Vertex-Cover" and the Travelling Salesman Problem.</line>
				<line>Solving these problems (P) can be accomplished in polynomial time!</line>
				<line>Verifying solutions (NP) can also be done in polynomial time!</line>
				<line>The question is... does P = NP?</line>

				<line>T-REX AND HIS DINOSAUR FRIENDS IN: "OLD PHOTOGRAPHS"</line>
				<line>You know those early photographs?  The silent, gloomy, sepia-toned ones?</line>
				<line>They're so sad!</line>
				<line>What gets me every time is the faces of people I'll never meet, people long dead, trying not to move as they stare into that early camera lens... but what ESPECIALLY always gets me are the faces of the people who did move.  This was for some the only time their face would be recorded, and they happened to shift.</line>
				<line>That's so sad!  That's profoundly sad!</line>
				<line>Is it because those blurred faces remind you that no matter what, the past can never be completely known?</line>
				<line>Kind of!  But I think what affects me the most if the idea of someone coming that close to achieving at least a type of immortality, and then losing it to something as natural and ordinary as glancing away.</line>
				<line>Early photography does have its own sense of sad nostalgia, doesn't it?</line>

				<line>There's nothing wrong with that!</line>
				<line>It saves the environment by using less paper!</line>
				<line>But where's the magic? Where's the love and care that is shown in a well-wrapped present?</line>
				<line>Replaced! Replaced with a healthy respect for the ENVIRONMENT.</line>
				<line>Plus it was cheaper!</line>
				<line>Wrapping gifts can be a complicated issue!</line>
				<line>Not really!</line>
				<line>Sure it is! Do you stay traditional and wrap presents nicely, in fancy paper - this can carry a lot of meaning - or try a more modern, environmentally-sensetive approach?</line>
				<line>Like wrapping them in the plastic bags they came in!</line>
				<line>Or maybe something just a LITTLE bit classier.</line>

				<line>We've all changed! It makes me more nostalgic for how things were before, just a year or two ago.  Not because things were better, but because they were different!  I always feel like I missed some opportunity, like I could have done something then that I can't do now.</line>
				<line>It's over now!</line>

				<line>Man, you'll never find me on a mountaineering expedition or on a voyage to find the Northwest Passage. No thanks!</line>
				<line>Do people not realize what's bound to happen?</line>
				<line>As I see it, you're pretty much asking to be put in a situation wherein the food runs out, people betray one another, frozen corpses of friends are found in the morning, and eventually everyone resorts to cannibalism.</line>
				<line>Well, you won't fool me! I know the stereotypes!</line>
				<line>But not all arctic exploration ends in cannibalism, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>Says you!</line>
				<line>You're just thinking of one or two famous instances! The problem is that nobody ever remembers when the food DOESN'T run out, the times when nobody ends up getting munched on.</line>
				<line>I can't help it if no cannibalism is less memorable than tons of cannibalism!</line>

				<line>In most cases, that's not balanced at all!</line>
				<line>For instance, if you're doing a story on how the sun is hot (assuming it's a slow news day), you don't spend half the story presenting a guy who thinks the sun is cold! You ignore the crazy minority.</line>
				<line>But often, when science is reported, equal credence is given to the kooks and their kooky theories! Science is presented as merely an opposing viewpoint.</line>
				<line>Wow, I had no idea you were so fascist!</line>
				<line>I'm not!</line>
				<line>"Hey everyone, look at me! I'm T-Rex! My truth is the right truth!"</line>
				<line>That's not me!</line>
				<line>There's degrees! Science is based on repeatable observation!</line>
				<line>Sounds like a fine line to me, my friend!</line>

				<line>Cephalopods? Like squid?</line>
				<line>Squid cuttlefish, and other similarly baleful creatures are all members of the cephalopod family, characterized by HUGE EYS, BEAKS, INTELLIGENCE, and AMBITION.</line>

		<title>politeness and insincerity and what have you</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>I concede that, sometimes, it's nice to be polite! However!</line>
				<line>I also believe that it's NOT nice to be insincere. I am in conflict!</line>
				<line>This is because there are situations in which being polite implies being insincere. For example, I may think someone looks pretty ridiculous in their fancy new hat, but if they ask me what I think, I'll try to say SOMETHING positive about it! In order not to hurt their feelings, I am polite in sharing my opinion.</line>
				<line>But it's understood that people will try to be polite, so this insincerity is okay!</line>
				<line>Huh?</line>
				<line>If everyone knows people are being insincere, then what's the point of polliteness? We end up in the same place, semantically speaking.</line>
				<line>Not really! Since there is always SOME doubt as to whether someone is just being polite, one can always take something as a compliment!</line>

				<line>Indeed I do!</line>
				<line>WELL! In some cases the patient will be too aware of what's going on, and the test won't work. In such cases the patient is asked to lock their hands togetehr and pull them in opposite directions. This distraction allows the test to succeed!</line>

				<line>LOGICAL FALLACY COMICS: today's fallacy: "THE STRAW MAN"</line>
				<line>The "Straw Man" fallacy isn't so much a fallacy as it is a way of life!</line>
				<line>In this fallacy, you present an altered version of your opponent's argument in order to make it appear absurd! You then tear apart this weaker, ridiculous argument and claim victory. Basically it can be summarized as "make stuff up and attribute it to your opponent"! Haha! EXCELLENT.</line>
				<line>What? It's not excellent, T-Rex! It's bad argument technique!</line>
				<line>Maybe!</line>
				<line>BUT, it's also a great way to win debates. And if anyone calls you on it, you just say "Come on. Your attack on me is the real straw man fallacy here; let's be serious."</line>
				<line>But that's wrong! Oh man, remind me never to debate you on the internet EVER.</line>

				<line>COMPRESSED THESIS COMICS: today's thesis: "Computational Measures of the Acceptability of Light Verb Constructions"</line>
				<line>Light verb constructions (LVCs) are constructions like "take a stroll" and "give a smile"!</line>
				<line>They are formed by combining a light verb (such as "take" and "give") with a complement ("stroll", "smile"). Most of the meaning of a (non-idiomatic) LVC comes from the complement ("stroll" and "smile").</line>
				<line>Amazing!</line>
				<line>I know!</line>
				<line>But aren't some LVCs more acceptable than others? </line>
				<line>Yes, this is true!</line>
				<line>It would be really nice to be able to measure that computationally.</line>
				<line>Sure would! Hmm, I wonder if statistical measures of association would correlate well with human judgement of construction acceptability?</line>

		<title>the problem of specialization</title>

				<line>So, throughout time, people have spent their youth learning, and the time after that applying what they've learned. Not a bad system!</line>
				<line>... For a first try!</line>
				<line>The problem is that we're spending longer and longer studyin. If you do a PhD, you could be 30 years old when you graduate! And since there's so much to know about the world, people are forced to specialize. Even at 30, there just isn't enough time to learn it all!</line>
				<line>It's a necessary tradeoff! Millions of people specialize and make tiny contributions to knowledge.</line>
				<line>It's true!</line>
				<line>But what if it didn't have to be that way? If we lived forever, we could learn so much! We could make connections between completely unrelated fields.</line>
				<line>This is true, but the older generation would always remain! If they became stuck in their ways, they might inhibit progress instead of helping.</line>

				<line>Let us talk today about a very important topic:</line>
				<line>Anger management!</line>
				<line>One must always manage their anger, lest it become under- or even un-managed and therefore out of control!  But we should also remember that emotions aren't good or bad things - it's what we do with them that matters.  For instance, anger can help us break things that would otherwise remain unbroken!  Like with...</line>
				<line>...pi?atas?</line>
				<line>So what's your anger management technique?</line>
				<line>I'm glad you asked!</line>
				<line>Whenever you feel angry and think maybe you shouldn't be upset, just repeat to yourself, "Don't be so angry okay?  Sheesh!"</line>
				<line>That's the most facile anger management technique I've ever heard!</line>
				<line>One might expect me to become hilariously angry at such a comment, but I'm managing my anger.</line>

				<line>THE ETYMOLOGY OF THE WORD "WOMAN" - IN COMIC FORM!</line>
				<line>Many people believe "woman" is a sexist term, due to its apparent base in the word "man"! This has led to crazy alternative spellings like "womyn" and even "wimmen".</line>
				<line>However, this is not the case!</line>
				<line>The word originally derives from the old English "wifmann", where "wif" meant "female" and "mann" meant a person of either sex: thus, a female human!</line>
				<line>Man didn't mean male?</line>
				<line>Nope! It derives from the Latin "humanus" (earthling), from "humus" (earth, soil)!</line>
				<line>And while "wif" meant female, "wer" meant male!</line>
				<line>Exactly!</line>
				<line>We can still see this today in words like "werewolf", which means, literally, a manwolf.</line>
				<line>So "werewolf" is actually a more sexist word than "woman"!</line>

				<line>Most people agree that a 26-year-old should be able to consent to sex, while a child should be protected from sexual predators, but where we legally draw that line is contentious!

				<line>Well, isn't this one of those topics that you'd talk about with friends in private, but not while out in a public place?  You don't want people to think you're a PEDOPHILE.</line>

				<line>HAPPY CANADA DAY COMICS </line>
				<line>a "PG-13" picto-story</line>
				<line>In Canada, you get real winters AND real summers, and there's places where you can get winter all year round if that's your sort of thing!</line>
				<line>Is that your sort of thing, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>That is HECK NO not my sort of thing, but I'm glad to know it's an option!</line>
				<line>Also, in Canada? Two chicks can totally get married!</line>
				<line>Neat!</line>
				<line>Finally, there is social liberalism and national pride, but not one that is predicated on making other countries seem worse.</line>
				<line>But doesn't that imply any countries that don't have that desirable feature are worse off than Canada?</line>
				<line>It - it does.  Well Heck!</line>
				<line>That's okay, T-Rex.</line>

				<line>I had the coolest dream last night.  BATMAN was in it!  And ZOMBIES!</line>
				<line>It was entirely great!</line>
				<line>Okay, so Gotham City is infected with zombies, right?</line>
				<line>People start getting bit, dying, then getting up and feasting on the flesh of the living.  Batman and Robin are fighting them off as best they can, and while they're too fast and acrobatic to be touched, there's too many zombies to kill them all.  They start rescuing as many people as they can, taking them to the Batcave for safekeeping.  It's a good place because it's not only big, but protected and hidden!</line>
				<line>So what happens next?</line>
				<line>Well, soon the Batcave is getting pretty full!</line>
				<line>And at some point they've rescued this guy who's been bitten, but who's hidden it.  He dies, and the next time Batman and Robin come back to the Cave, they find that everyone inside is now a zombie!  Their effort has been entirely futile, and everyone they've rescued is dead.</line>
				<line>Then what?</line>
				<line>Batman FLIPS OUT!!</line>
				<line>And I wake up, the end!</line>

				<line>Today is a good day I think to talk about phlogiston!</line>
				<line>That's right! Phlogiston, bitches!</line>
				<line>Phlogiston was proposed as a scientific explanation for combustion!  It was clear that some things burned (like wood), while other things would not burn (like ash).  Phlogiston was a colorless, odourless and weightless substance that was contained in things that could burn.  When they burned, the phlogiston was released into the air!</line>
				<line>That's a pretty crazy theory!</line>
				<line>Yeah, but it totally worked for a while!</line>
				<line>It explained why if you burned things in a jar, they would go out:  the air can only hold so much phlogiston!  But it started to fall apart when people discovered that some things, like magnesium, actually gained mass when burned.</line>
				<line>So phlogiston would have to have a negative mass!</line>
				<line>Yeah!  That seemed a little TOO krazy.  But its actually pretty close to what we now believe, only backwards!</line>
				<line>(We believe materials are deoxygenated and become oxygenated when burning!)</line>

				<line>Copyright is intended to prevent others from ripping off your creations! It used to extend 28 years after you created something, giving you a chance to profit while ensuring good ideas would eventually enter the public domain.</line>
				<line>However, lately it's gotten pretty ridiculous!</line>
				<line>Copyright extensions have pushed this protection up to the length of your life plus 70 years and beyond - basically, whenever Micky Mouse is due to enter the public domain, copyright law is extended.  It's unfair and it restricts creativity!</line>
				<line>How does it restrict creativity?</line>
				<line>Well!</line>
				<line>With these insanely long copyright laws, there is no new public domain, and our modern culture is owned and put in private hands! It ensures you can't build on anything that's been created in the past 70 years.</line>

		<title>the great library of alexandria</title>

			<panel>
				<line>Ah, the great Library of Alexandria! A repository of learning founded in the 3rd century BC, this library has become a powerful symbol for knowledge.</line>
				<line>Especially since it was destroyed by fire or maybe looting a few centuries later.</line>
				<line>Oh, what knowledge we have lost! What revelations were written on those ancient papyrus scrolls, now entirely beyond our grasp? With this lost information, could the industrial revolution have arrived a thousand years earlier? The only answer I can offer is an enthusiastic "perhaps!" followed by a wide-eyed "who knows??"</line>
				<line>Whoah, I think you're putting to much into this, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>It was a pretty great library!</line>
				<line>Yeah, but you're treating the actual libraries (plural) as a symbol, which only confuses what actually happened historically.  Certainly SOME ancient knowledge was lost, but I think it's disingenuous to suggest that its loss meant our development was set back thousands of years!</line>
				<line>You're saying that by building up the legend, I do a disservice to the actual libraries? Well, I've got news for you, my friend!</line>
				<line>Um!</line>

				<line>Science is based upon hypotheses, conclusions and theories formed via repeated observations and experiments!</line>
				<line>THE PHILOSOPHICAL BASIS OF SCIENCE</line>
				<line>This allows us to fashion an empirical and verifiable understanding of the world around us.  Theories are said to be correct if they match up with the observed properties of the universe! However, science makes the tacit assumption that the universe is predictable and orderly and regular, which MAY NOT BE THE CASE.</line>
				<line>I ask the question: what if some of the theories and laws of science were merely statistical?</line>
				<line>Explain!</line>
				<line>Well, we say the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, because it's been that every time we've measured it.  But what if there's a small chance that sometimes, the speed of light can just - change?</line>
				<line>You're questioning the basis of science by postulating a non-deterministic universe.</line>
				<line>Yeah man! In such a universe, science totally fails!</line>

				<line>I SIMPLY WISH TO ASCERTAIN YOUR OPINION ON CLASSIC GAME EMULATION</line>
				<line>THERE ARE OFTEN CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH A GAME'S COMPANY HAS FOLDED BUT THE GAME ITSELF REMAINS POPULAR</line>
				<line>IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IS IT ETHICAL TO COPY AND EMULATE THE GAME IN QUESTION</line>
				<line>T-That's actually a really interesting question!</line>
				<line>Which is, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>The question the Devil just asked me about "orphaned games!"</line>
				<line>It's actually just a subset of the larger problem of orphaned works still under copyright.  How can such works be dealt with when it's impossible or prohibitively expensive to figure out who owns the rights?</line>
				<line>Man I'll leave you to it! I'm going elsewhere to have an INTERESTING conversation.</line>

				<line>I think I put too much symbolism into random encounters with people I meet on the street! I see them as a microcosm for larger society.</line>
				<line>It is a problem with me!</line>
				<line>FOR EXAMPLE: the other day I saw some kids who had dropped their bag of marbles. It was a stereotypical image of childhood! But when I stopped to help them pick them up, they said, "No, don't touch them please."</line>
				<line>Ouch, man! What went wrong? Can we no longer trust a stranger's helping hand?</line>
				<line>Sure we can, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>Well, these kids couldn't!</line>
				<line>My mood was off for the rest of the day because of it. I was worrying about communities and stuff!</line>
				<line>This IS the danger in seeing kids as symbols rather than as real people who just want to pick up their own marbles.</line>

				<line>I've decided to write a story about my own team of superheroes. That's right! They're called...</line>
				<line>The Incr-- The Fant- The Sweet Dudes!</line>
				<line>So far I've got four people on the team. The first is Justin Time, who has time-based powers! The second is Justin Case, who can control probability. The third is Chix Diggit, who is an attractive dude if I do say so myself, and the last member is Tim Foresnax, who can eat a lot if he wants to! They fight crime and prejudice and have romantic (mis)adventures.</line>
				<line>This seems a little derivative, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>Nope! It is 100% my creation!</line>
				<line>Come on! "Justin Case"? "Justin Time"? Those are old names that weren't that funny to begin with.</line>
				<line>Well, Justin Time goes by his middle name, Tehnikov, because having two Justins on the team would be confusing. Get it?</line>
				<line>Their names sound like common phrases that people might say sometimes! "Just in the nick of time"? Hee hee!</line>
				<line>It's pretty implausible that someone named "Justin Time" would end up having temporal powers though.</line>

				<line>I went through a document of 100 million English words and counted each of them. You'll never guess what the most-often-used verb form in the English language is!</line>
				<line>It's "is"!</line>
				<line>The second-most-often used is "was", then "be" and "are" and "have" and "had".</line>
				<line>These are all pretty boring words, T-Rex. Most are just forms of the same verb!</line>

				<line>One of the great myths of our time is that the trick to becoming good at something is to practice it over and over.</line>
				<line>I'm afraid that I must respectfully disagree!!</line>
				<line>PROOF BY COUNTEREXAMPLE: I have probably practiced eating hundreds of thousands of times! And yet, sometimes I screw it up. Practice clearly hasn't helped me here, because I should be super awesome at eating things now!</line>
				<line>You screw it up?</line>
				<line>I choke! It goes down the wrong tube or whatever. It's very embarrassing and sometimes I require medical attention.</line>
				<line>Well, to be fair, there's a difference between practicing eating and just doing many times over many years, T-Rex.</line>
				<line>When you're practicing, you're more aware of what you're doing, examining your own actions actions with an eye for improvement. It's a focus one dosen't have while simply eating as a matter of routine.</line>
				<line>Perhaps it's a focus YOU don't have, dude! You forget that I am extremely intense.</line>
				<line>And I can prove it, too! Ask me how my day was.</line>

				<line>Time to check up on that utopian society I founded! I bet everything is totally perfect there in Utopia Land.</line>
				<line>SOON:</line>
				<line>They MOVED?!</line>
				<line>My utopian society moved, Dromiceiomimus! They moved away!</line>
				<line>What do you mean?</line>
				<line>Just that! They packed up everything they could and moved somewhere else, and it's not somewhere nearby! They clearly thought things would be more utopic if they moved further away from ME. Argh!  I hate those guys so much right now!</line>
				<line>But maybe they didn't move, T-Rex! Maybe they just DISAPPEARED!</line>
				<line>Huh?</line>
				<line>They're a utopian society, right? But the term "utopia" is a neo-logistic pun in Greek! There, depending on how the word is pronounced ("eu" or "ou"), it means EITHER 'good place' OR 'no place'. In English the "u" handles both these sounds, so 'utopia' actually contains both of these meanings!</line>
				<line>That's ridiculous! They didn't phase out of existence for the sake of a pun.  You're just using this as an excuse to cram an etymology lesson where it doesn't belong!</line>

				<line>I was asked for money on the street today, and after I gave what change I had, I was told quite aggressively by the guy that it wasn't enough! This can only mean that it's time once again to discuss everyone's favourite topic. . . </line>
				<line>Panhandling!</line>
				<line>And it's a tricky issue! Giving money to beggars can be helpful, but some feel it encourages bad behavior and undermines the work of social support organizations. Plus there is always the rumour of beggars who take home hundreds of dollars a day! On the other hand, there may well be people for whom begging is the only means of support they have.</line>
				<line>You're sure using a lot of qualifiers there, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>It's intentional!</line>
				<line>I really don't know very much about panhandling, and a lot of people feel really strongly about it. I don't know! I usually try to learn more about things by doing them, but if I panhandled I'd be a total poseur.</line>

				<line>Does language alter the way we think?  Sources say: perhaps!</line>
				<line>This source says: DEFINITELY YES.</line>
				<line>I think it's a subtle but pervasive effect!  If a language doesn't have a word for something, I think I'm less likely to think about whatever it is that word would refer to.  For instance, in English we have words for "friends", but what if we had a single word for the phrase "friends who deserve pie more often"?  I bet I'd consider buying people more pies!</line>
				<line>You're saying that if we had words for these things, people would think of them more often?</line>
				<line>Yeah!</line>
				<line>Well, I agree, but I think you're confusing cause and effect!  As things become more prominent, they move to become words.  Like "electronic mail" becoming "e-mail" and finally "email" - that was due to email becoming more popular, not because people were creating the word in order to MAKE IT more popular.  You know?</line>

				<line>Now I'm all about "Do unto others AS they do unto you". Notice the lack of a "would have". Actually, NOW I'm all about "do unto others before they do unto you." No wait! "Do unto others at the same time as they are doing unto you". That one is about doing things together with friends, I think!</line>

				<line>JOKES EXPLAINED PRESENTS: "CONFUCIUS SAY"</line>
				<line>This vaguely-racist form of comedy relies upon the double-entendre!  It narrates the advice of a man called "Confucius" who delivers many a "bon mot".</line>
				<line>For example: "Confucius say... man who run in front of car get tired!"</line>
				<line>Ho ho!  Did you catch the comedy there?  There are two meanings in that phrase!  If you don't get it, don't worry - the key to emulating understanding is often just to repeat the last word or phrase.  Fake a laugh, say "Hah!  TIRED." and you will be SET.</line>
				<line>Was there a real-life Confucius, T-Rex, or is he merely a convenient fictional device?</line>
				<line>Well!</line>
				<line>As you know, there was in fact a real Confucius.  He lived in the 5th century in Ancient China (then called "China") and was and is an incredibly well-respected philosopher!</line>
				<line>Indeed!</line>
				<line>So yea, you've got to be careful, because the real Confucius said many non-hilarious things.</line>
				<line>Phrases like "they who know the truth are not equal to those who love it" are not meant to be laughed at!  SO DON'T EVEN TRY.</line>

				<line>My stars, do I ever love documentary films.  The best form of filmmaking?</line>
				<line>As I see it, yes!</line>
				<line>What I've come to love is the tension between filmmaker and subject, the way editing can so easily be used to slip the filmmaker's politics into the film.  The veneer of realism, the claim of legitimacy - ooh!  It's all so GOOD.  There's politics in every film, sure, but only documentary makes the claim of truth, and it's THAT claim that makes it all so interesting.</line>
				<line>You're still on about documentary film?</line>
				<line>Dude!  It's SO GOOD.</line>
				<line>My favourite are the extended takes, where you ask your subject a question, they answer it, and then you hold the camera on them for a good ten seconds afterwards while they glance around and look ridiculous.</line>
				<line>It is a great way to subtly undermine your subject without saying a word.</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Intelligent design (or ID) is the idea that while we may begin to understand the universe through science, it is actually created with divine intent.  Evolution is not the chaotic product of random mutations, but rather intentional.</line>
				<line>Much as a watch implies a watchmaker, so does our universe imply divinity!</line>
				<line>Okay!  It's a very nice idea, but it's not science because it's not disprovable: you either believe in intelligent design or you don't, and there's no way to show who's right.  That's not science - that's faith!</line>
				<line>And whould faith be held to the rigors of the scientific method?</line>
				<line>Of course not!</line>
				<line>The issue is that some think ID should be taught in schools as an alternative to evolution, right?</line>
				<line>Right!</line>
				<line>But there's nothing in ID (as I've formulated it) to say that the two can't exist peacefully.  One just doesn't belong in science class, because it's not a science.  It belongs in religion class.</line>

				<line>I think you'd still be able to see things, actually!</line>

		<title>learnability of natural languages comics THAT'S RIGHT</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Learning a language is hard!  It is especially hard with your first language, when you're a baby who has to figure out an entire grammar and vocabulary just from what people say to you.</line>
				<line>It's not just hard: in fact, it may well be impossible!</line>
				<line>It turns out that natural languages are so complex that we probably can't figure out all their rules just from hearing words spoken around us, but we CAN approximate these rules and get very close.  So the result is we (as learners) end up speaking a language we're able to communicate with, wut which is slightly different than those that surround us!</line>
				<line>How slight a difference are we talking about here?</line>
				<line>That depends on the learner, I guess!</line>
				<line>Rules that are used everyday are going to be more fixed, because there's more of a chance somebody will correct you.  But less-frequent parts will be more malleable, which explains why languages evolve so quickly!</line>
				<line>Because a language is never passed down, just an approximation of a language.</line>
				<line>Yep!  Of course this has changed a little with the advent of grammar books and formal schooling, but it's still there.  For example, I might think the word 'tenet' is enraging!</line>

				<line>Oh goodness, cryptography.  It's really interesting!</line>
				<line>Specifically, trapdoor functions are SUPER interesting!  Times two!</line>
				<line>These are functions that are easy to compute but difficult to reverse-engineer - unless you have the secret 'trapdoor' information.  For example, the product of two prime numbers (p and q) is not hard to figure out if you know their values (it's just multiplication!), but if all you have is the answer, n, guessing what p and q are can take a really long time.</line>
				<line>And yeah, functions like this are a basis of cryptography!</line>
				<line>How's that?</line>
				<line>Well, say I send n to you, and you know what the secret value of p is.  There's a chance my message might be intercepted by a bad guy.  But this dude will only know n, not p!</line>
				<line>So I'll be able to figure out q easily, knowing what n and p are, but this guy will be totally stumped!</line>
				<line>Yep!  Of course, all this lets us do is communicate a prime number q in secret to each other.  But you can probably do even more things with trapdoor functions!</line>

				<line>I've decided to stalk a friend! Hah hah, why not? I will be the person they least suspect!</line>
				<line>This is because I'm violating the understood limits of our friendship!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus, I'm going to let you in on a secret, okay? I have decided to stalk Utahraptor! Can you help me out?</line>
				<line>I can and I will!  This is all in good fun, right?</line>
				<line>RIGHT.  We are NOT allowed to murder him.</line>
				<line>A FEW DAYS LATER:</line>
				<line>T-Rex, I think I've got a stalker!</line>
				<line>Hee! That's too bad!</line>
				<line>Yeah, it's not actually that bad a deal yet.  This guy just calls me and tells me he knows where I live, and I'm like, okay, and then he giggles and hangs up.  I think he's new to this.  Sometimes a woman calls too.</line>

				<line>Tonight is Hallowe'en, and that means...</line>
				<line>... treats! Hooray! Hooray for treats!</line>
				<line>Are you - you're going trick-or-treating this year, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>Sure am! I have decided that giving it up when I achieved pubescence was a MISTAKE. I am going to dress up and go door-to-door and get candies! Woo! All I need is a costume and a way to minimize embarrassment.</line>

				<line>THAT NIGHT, AT THE PARTY:</line>
				<line>Hi guys! It turns out the reason adults don't go trick-or-treating is because you get berated at every house for being too old! Also some kids tricked me and stole my costume!</line>

		<title>Egoism!</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>I have discovered a new philosophy for life that appeals to my own sense of self-worth!</line>
				<line>Egoism!</line>
				<line>In egoism, all your actions are motivated by a desire to make things easy for one person: yourself! For instance, I crush this house because it's in my way. My actions are justified, thanks to egoism!</line>
				<line>But what about yourself? You're only here because your parents selflessly decided to have children. Your very existence is against egoism.</line>
				<line>They probably realized what a great dinosaur I'd be and figured it would be in their own interests to creat me!</line>
				<line>What the hell?</line>
				<line>First off, I don't know why you need egoism to justify the destruction you're going to wreak ANYWAY. Second off, egoism doesn't account for charity, unless you reduce it to 'good will in the bank', saved for some future benefit. That in turn doesn't account for charity seen in lesser animals, who aren't cognizant of such self-centered account-keeping. In conclusion: it's untenable.</line>
				<line>"In conclusion: it's untenable"? YOU MUST BE A LOT OF FUN AT PARTIES!</line>

		<title>too many friends?</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Is it possible to have too many friends?</line>
				<line>The answer is "Definitely yes!"</line>
				<line>This is because if you were friends with EVERYONE ever in the history of time, you'd have so many people who'd expect you to talk with them on the phone and hang out with them and stuff, and there's only so many hours in a day! Eventually you'd end up snubbing at least SOME of them, which is bad.</line>
				<line>Therefore, yes, it is possible to have too many friends!</line>
				<line>You know, talking like this risks backlash, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>How so?</line>
				<line>Well, few people worry about having too many friends, and those who feel like they could maybe use some more friends might become resentful.  It's not the sort of thing you go looking for sympathy about.</line>
				<line>I don't have too many friends! I was speaking hypothetically!</line>
				<line>I could use some more friends, actually.  I tried calling an escort service once but it turns out that is a euphemism and all the people there were just interested in sex for money!</line>
				<line>I was like "Hah hah, what?"</line>

				<line>Hey T-Rex, do you want to hang out on New Year's Eve?</line>

				<line>Didn't you graduate years ago?</line>
				<line>Shhh!</line>
				<line>Hey, why are you setting up learning on your own and learning in a classroom as opposites?</line>
				<line>It's not you can't do both! Learning is learning, and some ways work better for some people.</line>
				<line>Well, I've also incorporated into my auto-didacticism a distrust of schools as inefficient, repressive institutions.  It's part of my new "damn the man" persona!</line>

				<line>I sometime wonder if I've become too dependent on my daily routine.</line>

				<line>You will symbolize change through repetition?</line>
				<line>DO NOT LESSEN THE METAPHOR!</line>
				<line>What does the girl represent?</line>

				<line>(left elbow down, right elbow up) The crazy Utahraptor thinks I have OCD.</line>
				<line>(open mouth) I wonder what that stands for.  "Overly Competent Dinosaur"</line>
				<line>(Left foot, stomp house.) Or perhaps "Outstandingly Creative Dialogue".....Hey Dromiceiomimus, did you hear? Utahraptor thinks I am "One cool Dude"!</line>
				<line>I am filled with my "Ordinarily Cautious Doubt"</line>
				<line>(Turn around, stomp girl.) Hey Utahraptor, I really appreciate that you think I'm "Oh-so Clever and Delightful"!</line>
				<line>What?</line>
				<line>OCD stands for "Obsessive Compulsive Disorder"! It means you are consumed by the constant need to do something, in this case, stomp.</line>
				<line>Oh, Crap! Detected!</line>
				<line>Holy crap! There's a bomb in the comic.</line>

				<line>I'd better run!</line>
				<line>Now that he is gone I can freely admit that there never was a bomb.  I just wanted an excuse to stomp!</line>
				<line>I am reliving the same day of my life over and over again until I get it right.</line>

				<line>SOON:</line>
				<line>So, how's the experiment going?</line>
				<line>TOTALLY SUCKY!</line>
				<line>I can't figure out what I should be testing. What are some instincts people have?</line>
				<line>Oh, well, you could always put your favourite food in your mouth and try not to chew or swallow it. It's possible to do this, but the desire to eat it is strong. Tada! Instinct!</line>
				<line>Ooh! OR, I could surround myself with attractive and sexually-available women and then try not to have the intercourse with them!</line>

				<line>Dear lottery officials: I would not have such troubles!</line>

				<line>Which charity?</line>
				<line>Huh?</line>
				<line>Which charity would you donate to? Is it perhaps a charity dedicated towards RESUSCITATING YOUR DESICCATED CORPSE?</line>

				<line>This isn't a race, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>It is, and you started it!</line>

				<line>Wait - was I just saying that it is objectively and verifiably true that murder is always wrong? That's a pretty big statement.Or was I merely saying that it's the societal consensus of most that murder is not such a good idea? Maybe it's an emotional statement, saying "I'm against murder, personally". Or MAYBE it's more of an imperative, better phrased as "Don't murder!"</line>
				<line>We've built a whole system around ethics and you're questioning its foundation!</line>
				<line>That's right, baby!</line>

				<line>Didn't the grocery store have a parking lot, Morris?</line>

				<line>It's a world where everyone knows how they're going to die!</line>
				<line>You can go in to a doctor and he takes a blood test, and then his machine spits out a piece of paper that says "exploded" or "drowned" or "poisoned apple" and that's it.  No dates, no details!  And so people who are to die from drowning spend their lives avoiding swimming pools, but they end up drowning anyway.  Part of the fun would be seeing how!</line>

				<line>Unfortunately, all the good ones are taken. Sucks to THAT!</line>
				<line>There are a ton of people who have died saying things like "I feel fine!", but irony is overdone in last words. It has to be something fresh! Einstein spoke his last words in German, but the only person present didn't speak the language, so his last words are lost. That's actually pretty neat, I think! I could learn some obscure language before I die and use that as a backup plan.</line>
				<line>It's too bad you're not a doctor!</line>
				<line>Why's that?</line>
				<line>There's been a few doctors who have died just after having said "stopped", which isn't that eerie until you're told that they were checking their pulse at the time.</line>

				<line>They also helped in the research that eradicated polio!</line>
				<line>So not only are HeLa cells the first observed example of devolution or speciation in human beings (going from a multi-celled life form to a singe-celled one) but they're also maybe a first example of immortality: her cells live, but the woman from whom the cells were taken, Henrietta Lacks, died from this cancer in 1951. That's crazy!</line>
				<line>Crazier: there's probably a greater mass of HeLa cells now than there was of Henrietta when she was alive!</line>
				<line>Yeah!</line>
				<line>The whole thing is so surreal, don't you think? The woman made a huge contribution to society just by getting sick. And imagine a new species EVOLVING from your body?</line>
				<line>Well, Henrietta never found out. She was never even told that the cells were being cultivated!</line>

				<line>Holy smokes, but that's a pretty awesome expression! "That dude just fell down the stairs! Holy smokes!" It has the charm of a child, yet is better than the old standby of "holy cow" because nobody says "holy smokes" anymore.  It is forgotten. It is UNDISCOVERED.</line>

				<line>Holy crap yes!</line>
				<line>Oh man, robots. So awesome! What other literary construct allows us to discuss the disparate issues of slavery, prejudice, identity, the body AND the self, while also allowing for all the trappings of a science fiction setting? Only robots, my friends!</line>
				<line>I would seriously marry robots if it were even possible.</line>
				<line>In fact, the only fault I can find in robots is with their real life counterparts!</line>
				<line>Why's that?</line>
				<line>They're a canonical study in failed promise!  They never try to take over the world and rarely act as a mirror of our own essential humanity.  They just sit around!</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>LOGICAL FALLACY COMICS</line>
				<line>today's fallacy</line>
				<line>BEGGING THE QUESTION</line>
				<line>Begging the question is when what you're trying to prove is assumed implicitly in one of your premises!</line>
				<line>FOR EXAMPLE: T-Rex is a pretty sweet dude because he's always so friggin' awesome!</line>
				<line>This is actually formally valid: if the premise is true and I'm friggin' awesome, then it follows that I'm a pretty sweet dude.  However, I've provided no logical support for my "T-Rex is awesome" premise, but only made a conclusion (T-Rex = pretty sweet) which relies on the premise being true.  I haven't offered any evidence, so I am begging the question!</line>
				<line>But "begging the question" is mostly used today to mean "raising the question"!</line>
				<line>I know!  IT'S SO WRONG.</line>
				<line>Well, I suppose that begs the question, T-Rex: if it's used more often to mean "raises the question" than "a fallacy of presumption", doesn't that suggest that the definition of the phrase has evolved?</line>
				<line>NO IT DOES NOT.  What it suggests is that everybody sucks but me!</line>

		<title>religious issues solved in this comic: zero!</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>I've never had any problems with dating someone of a different religion, but I imagine under certain circumstances it could be a problem!</line>
				<line>Much like... most things?</line>
				<line>I guess if there was some religious beliefs that one person had and the other didn't, it could lead to tension, but relationships are about compromise, right? But if someone, say, adopts the actions of a religion as a compromise, but not the beliefs behind it, isn't that just going through the motions, which isn't really what most religions are about?</line>
				<line>I guess a lot of it depends on the faith of the people involved, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>How so?</line>
				<line>Well, if you REALLY believe that by not sharing your religion, your partner is harming himself somehow (i.e., comdemning himself to a sucky afterlife), then you'd want to help him out, right? I could see that leading to tension, since there's not much room for movement there unless one of you softens your views.</line>
				<line>That's true! Luckily, as I say, this has never happened to me. Therefore, double high fives for conflict avoided??</line>

				<line>Vitamin B12: What is it?</line>
				<line>Vitamin B12, also called cobalamin, is important to good health.</line>
				<line>It helps maintain healthy nerve and red blood cells, and is also needed to make DNA, the genetic material in all cells. Vitamin B12 is bound to the protein in food.</line>
				<line>What foods provide vitamin B12?</line>
				<line>Beef liver, fish, eggs, and milk, among others.</line>
				<line>What is the health risk of too much vitamin B12?</line>
				<line>Vitamin B12 has a very low potential for toxicity.</line>
				<line>Vegetarians who do not eat meats, fish, eggs, milk or milk products are at high risk of developing a vitamin B12 deficiency!</line>
				<line>Individuals with stomach and small intestinal disorders may not absorb enough vitamin B12 from food to maintain healthy body stores.</line>

				<line>DEMOCRACY COMICS</line>
				<line>It sucks, because if everyone disagrees with you, then you'll never get anything you want. It's majority rule! MOB rule!</line>
				<line>Well, majority rule is sort of the definition of democracy, T-Rex. Not everyone can get everything they want!</line>
				<line>Yeah, but what if the majority decide to be totally racist against you? You're pooched!</line>
				<line>People have worried about this before, my friend!</line>
				<line>What do they say?</line>
				<line>Well, what you're worried about is called the "tyranny of the majority", and it's usually countered by the observation that there's at least a push for minority rights being respected in a democracy, since we're all minorities in one way or another.</line>
				<line>Right! Like how I'm in a minority because I sometimese like to sleep in on weekends.</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Vegetarians are chicks and dudes who don't eat a lot of meat for some reason or whatever!</line>
				<line>DIFFERENT TYPES OF VEGETARIANISM</line>
				<line>First off, you've got your lacto-ovo vegetarians, who don't eat meat but do eat eggs and milk. There's also lacto vegetarians and ovo vegetarians. Then you've got your vegans, who don't eat meat or ANY animal products, so eggs, honey, milk, and cheese are out, and even leather sometimes. For - for shoes.</line>
				<line>And pants?</line>
				<line>My favorite are the freegans!</line>
				<line>Where you be vegetarian for free?</line>
				<line>Close! It's where you don't eat meat unless you're given it for free, like from a dumpster. You prevent meat from going to waste, but you don't support its production.</line>
				<line>That sounds close to flexitarians, who only eat meat when being vegetarian would be rude or inconvenient!</line>
				<line>Now, I myself am a tremendo-meatatarian, which means that I only eat meat that I find to be tremendously delicious! </line>
				<line>I've seen you eat fruits and vegetables!</line>
				<line>Yes. On account of the golly gosh-darned scurvy.</line>

				<line>So the questions is:</line>

				<line>Since an individual can "evolve" over time, what makes them a person at all?  Is there no connection between myself as a child and myself now, besides the fact that we share a (now post-pubescent) body?</line>

				<line>Why should we bother assigning an identity to what is essentially one frame of a constantly-changing motion picture.</line>
				<line>T-Rex!</line>
				<line>I think you are overanalyzing this.  People change, that is part of life.  Just because we're in a state of gradual evolution doesn't mean we have no identity; indeed, that identity is probably what's guiding the evolution.</line>

				<line>AN APOLOGY TO PLANTS</line>

In doing so, they accelerate their pollen at rocket speeds and blast it out at over four meters per second. That's some fast pollen! And I am not a dude who's gonna say that naturally weaponized flowers aren't cool.</line>

				<line>What? I bet you read just one fantasy book and it happened to have a boring horse that talked about feelings, T-Rex.</line>
				<line>One was enough!!</line>
				<line>You do know the two genres are closely related, right?</line>
				<line>They're actually not!</line>
				<line>It is a common misconception that science fiction is just fantasy with a justification for the fantastic elements. What people forget is that science fiction rules and fantasy...</line>
				<line>...drools?</line>
				<line>Precisely, my friend. In three different ways.</line>
				<line>I DON'T KNOW T-REX I'M STILL NOT CONVINCED THAT YOU CAN DISMISS AN ENTIRE GENRE</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>People are sad sometimes, and that makes me very sad.  Therefore, I will dedicate my memorable "problem solving skills" towards solving the problem of sadness once and for all!</line>
				<line>WAYS TO BE HAPPY</line>
				<line>Way to be happy #1: amnesia!  Forget your problems!</line>
				<line>This has the problem of robbing you of your present, history, and self, however.  Most people like those things!  So Method #2 is using happiness-inducing DRUGS and ALCOHOL.</line>
				<line>That seems to have many of the same limitations as Method #1!</line>
				<line>TRUE.  But I have other methods!  Method #3 is having a rewarding and satisfying professional and personal life.  Tada!</line>
				<line>But that's more a definition of happiness than a guide to achieving it, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>OKAY.</line>
				<line>Luckily, I still have Method #4, which is to set unreasonably low expectations for everyone, including yourself.</line>
				<line>THAT only works if you're euphoric whenever expectations are met.</line>
				<line>MAN! EVERYONE is making it really hard for me to solve the eternal problem of unhappiness!</line>
				<line>BUT THEN, INSPIRATION!  A PERFECT SOLUTION FOR ENDLESS JOY!</line>

		<title>how to be? remarkable!</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Everybody wants to be remarkable!  Here are some awesome ways to be remarkable:</line>
				<line>The first is to go further in something than anyone has before!</line>
				<line>For example, maybe you could eat a whole lot of goldfish or swallow tons of orange juice?  Simply think of something people already do, then think of a reasonable limit to that activity, and THEN shoot past it!  It's the "go further than anybody else would ever want to" technique!</line>
				<line>Remarkable?</line>
				<line>Precisely!</line>
				<line>Do you think everyone wants to be remarkable, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>Aww!  Shooting down my ideas?</line>
				<line>No!  I didn't mean to.  I was just wondering if you thought everyone wants to be unique, or if some can be satisfied with just a simple life, quietly well lived.</line>
				<line>Well, I suppose the idea of remarkability ties in with a desire for fame, which I SUSPECT is merely a corruption of wanting to be respected.</line>
				<line>So yeah!  I can see wanting to be respected but not wanting to be remarkable - it almost seems nobler than otherwise.</line>
				<line>Anyway!</line>
				<line>You can ALSO be remarkable by, holy shit, memorably cussin'!</line>

				<line>You're good at making friends though, T-Rex!  You're not shy!</line>

				<line>It was thought to be caused by the malfunction, or sometimes just the presence, of the uterus. Women were crazy because their wombs were so wacky! People went as far to suggest that women should not be taught, because enlarging the brain would shrink the womb, making them useless as mothers and even MORE hysterical. Treatment sometimes included genital massage!</line>

				<line>I am using the second "it" to refer to my entire experience watching the show, of course, and not to the show in particular.  The program was exactly the sort of thing I had long wanted to see on television!  I HAD vaguely sort of planned to maybe try my hand at writing television, but there's no point now, because the talent behind last night's episode have accomplished all that I would have like to have done. THANKS TELEVISION INDUSTRY.</line>
				<line>I would like to extrapolate this up to the societal level!</line>
				<line>Please do!</line>
				<line>WELL!  Things are great for society but it sort of sucks for the individual, because we can flawlessly record and cheaply reproduce all transcendent artistic work.  So as an artist, you no longer have to be the best in your village, you have to be the best in the world!</line>

				<line>I have been trying, UNSUCCESSFULLY, to write a poem for the past half hour.  I am trying to capture the emotion of getting up early in winter, during a heavy snowfall, and going for a walk and coming across a set of traffic lights (the kind that switch automatically) controlling traffic that isn't there, traffic that won't be there for hours.  The sense of seeing them as art, of watching them through the snowfall in the crisp dusk of a new day.</line>
				<line>So let's hear what you've written so far!</line>
				<line>Okay, but I warn you: it is unfinished.</line>
				<line>"Once upon a time / Some traffic lights did time / Colours on the snow / Where oh where did they all go?"</line>

				<line>Spooky!</line>
				<line>Not really, since there's nothing buried there yet!  It is pure FORESHADOWING.</line>
				<line>Huh!  It seems less cool knowing that it's been done before.  But I guess I COULD still visit my grave and pretend to be a time traveler who's changed the past!  The whole "Noo!  I changed the past!" idea.  You know?</line>

				<line>Friends are good things to have! They can help you out when you are sad (a psychological benefit), and can lend you money if you need it (an economic benefit)!</line>
				<line>It is these positive benefits of having friends that concern me!</line>
				<line>I'm pretty sure I like my friends because of the people they are, but what if I'm just kidding myself? What if I really just like them because they're an economic cushion - someone to bail me out, even literally, if I get into trouble?</line>
				<line>Dromiciomimus: Well - I mean, you'd do the same thing for us, T-Rex.</line>
				<line>Exactly! We hedge our bet by having friends!</line>
				<line>There are friendships that go beyond this shared benefit, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>How so?</line>
				<line>Okay - what about "best friends forever", the people in your life who you'll know will stand by you no matter what?</line>
				<line>They are even MORE of an economic benefit! They are get out of jail free cards, people who you can rely on in any situation.</line>
				<line>Wait!! My problem's that I'm seeing any positive effect of friendship as income, and thus everyone involved in one as compromised in a conflict of interest. I would only be happy if having friends was awful! Thanks, rare and brilliant moments of perfect self-awareness!</line>

		<title>you can be against terrorism AND also against the phrase 'intellectual terrorism', OKAY</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>I learnt a new phrase today!</line>
				<line>"Intellectual terrorism!"</line>
				<line>"I first thought it was a ridiculous phrase, both on its own and with all the phrases it suggested, like "emotional terrorism" and "pseudo-intellectual terrorism". But if ideas are powerful, then maybe you can terrorize someone with them! Maybe? Then again, "intellectual terrorism" comes very close to saying that ideas I disagree with or find distasteful are wrong, and worse, damaging and weaponized. Whatever, intellectual terrorism!</line>
				<line>How'd you hear a phrase like that?</line>
				<line>In just the way you'd think!</line>
				<line>Someone didn't like what they were reading, so they defined its contents as "terrorism". I think they were serious.</line>
				<line>It does sort of suggest that if someone said just the right words to you, you'd become instantly paralyzed with a life-shattering fear.</line>

				<line>That's very apt, T-Rex.</line>
				<line>Thanks!</line>
				<line>And - your metaphor includes stomping on women, somehow?</line>
				<line>Yes!</line>
				<line>For you see, the woman represents years of build-up of grime and dirt. By stomping on her I illustrate cleaning power - not of any household cleaner, but of simply applying yourself!</line>

				<line>Aww! I'm sorry, imaginary dude!</line>
				<line>That is pretty sad, T-Rex! If you want some advice, my secret to making things sad has always been in filling out the background details.

				<line>I have started a radio show! It is an advice show. People can call me and I will give them advice on all of their problems, from being locked out of their house to being EMOTIONALLY locked out of their house in a RELATIONSHIP.</line>
				<line>I call it, "I Know! I'll Ask T-Rex About My Stupid Problems!"</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomomimus: Do you think people will call into a show with that title, T-Rex? They'd be, you know, tacitly admitting that their problems are stupid.</line>
				<line>This is a good thing! Stupid problems, like "I bought too much mayonnaise", are easy to solve. (The solution is to give away, return, or consume the extra mayonnaise.)</line>
				<line>But what if people call in with real problems?</line>
				<line>Easy: my mom answers them!</line>
				<line>We're going to team up. I'll answer the silly questions, and there'll be a feature called "Ask T-Rex's Mom", where she'll answer all the hard questions. Moms are really good at things like that.</line>
				<line>That's a really charming answer!</line>
				<line>LATER, RECORDING "ASK T-REX'S MOM"!</line>
				<line>T-Rex's Mom: Dear Stranded On The Moon, that's an interesting problem you have there. It's almost as interesting as how a full grown T-Rex could forget Mother's Day!</line>

				<line>Primitivism is the artistic and cultural idea that prehistorical and tribal societies were, and are, better that modern societies.</line>
				<line>Okay guys! Whatever!</line>
				<line>The trouble I have with primitivism is the half-assed way it's always evoked: it's this simplified idea of "primitive" cultures, where some things get highlighted while a lot of detail gets ignored or obliterated completely. All the women were totally topless and all the men wore body paint and hunted with spears! Life was good in the forest!</line>
				<line>Primitivism has this strange semi-positive racism attached to it too.</line>
				<line>Semi-positive?</line>
				<line>Yeah! You exaggerate traits as you often do with racism, but you make them positive things instead of negative. Natives were better because they were all stoic and noble and loved Mother Nature. Okay, great, but what if you're native and you're not like that?</line>

				<line>BUT, none of them are so tough or so smart as to not be afraid of death (here we are ignoring sage Buddhist dudes who are probably not actually afraid of death). So! In a state of nature, everyone wants to avoid being killed, and so will defend themselves when faced with death. But since we need resources like food and water to live, and they're not infinite, we are constantly warring with one another for access to them.</line>
				<line>Everyone is fighting everyone in and ENDLESS BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL!</line>
				<line>And the only way out?</line>
				<line>That's for us to realize that war sucks (it makes us die too), and so to give up a little of our freedom in exchange for an ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY who will ensure internal peace and common defence. Tada!</line>

				<line>But "true love" doesn't mean that there's only one person you can have it with!</line>

				<line>I think that you're being too strict about this, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>How's that?</line>
				<line>You're reading it as if there's one "true" person that "true love" can refer to, meaning that you've got ONE CHANCE for total happiness in the world, and loving anyone else is just settling for second place or worse!

				<line>SOCIoLOGICAL THEORY: We, as a people, have lost the "big picture", worrying more about problems at home than problems that affect us on a planetary scale! We have lost a sense of global purpose. And I have proof!</line>

				<line>What makes you think this, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>Popular music! I just said. Popular music. Because in the 60s it was all, "everyone around the world, join hands", but recently, it's all "people in the house, say 'wayoooh'" or whatever. We are singularly focused on rooms in houses and have forgotten the rest of the world! Theory: incontestably proven?</line>

				<line>You can't really live your life in fear of bad things happening, my friend!</line>
				<line>Oh, it's not fear.</line>
				<line>It's just - a preemptive sadness, I guess? Melancholy.  By "melancholy" I mean "a thoughtful sadness" as opposed to the archaic definition ("a black bile once believed to be excreted by the kidneys").</line>
				<line>I got that from context, yeah.</line>
				<line>EPILOGUE:</line>
				<line>I stomped on people while talking about how sad it is when bad things happen!  This is an example of "dramatic irony".</line>

				<line>I dreamt I was a cockfighter!</line>
				<line>T-Rex Only, I wasn't a regular cockfighter, who battles his animals against those of an opponent.  It was with turkeys instead of chickens, and rather than fighting each other, I raced my own turkey around the countryside.  Halfway through the race we started fighting - I would punch and the turkey would hop up and peck me.  I remember holding back my punches a bit because I didn't want to be known as the kind of dude who would punch out a turkey.</line>
				<line>LATER: RUMOURS SPREAD.</line>
				<line>Hey!  You punch out turkeys?</line>
				<line>No!</line>
				<line>That was in a dream.  A DREAM.  I never actually punched out a turkey.</line>

				<line>TWO SECONDS LATER: </line>
				<line>Done and DONE!</line>
				<line>All I'll need to do is ask old people about their lives, and measure how many of them regret certain things! This "regret index" will range from 0 (no regret) to 1 (total ultimate regret). With it, I can tell kids today that if you rub spider eggs into your eyes, you're 96% likely to regret it, but if you drink delicious lemonade and pop wheelies, the regret index on that is near 0!</line>

				<line>I have come up with a perfect way not to believe in anything wrong ever again.  Evidentialism</line>
				<line>A belief is justified only if there is sufficient evidence to support it!</line>
				<line>Therefore, I won't believe in things like faith healing, because there's no room for faith in evidentialism!  I also don't believe there's convincing evidence for anyone having kissed someone SO HARD that both people exploded, so I will have to regretfully concede that I don't believe that's happened yet either. But, at least I won't believe in anything I can't prove!  Thanks, evidentialism!</line>
				<line>But - how do you know to believe your evidence, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>Dude! It's EVIDENCE.</line>
				<line>Yeah, but this evidence must need justification to be believed.  So evidence requires its own evidence, and so you have an infinite chain of proof.  This spells disaster for you my friend!</line>
				<line>A valid attack, perhaps strengthened by the old "What if we're all just brains in jars" question!</line>
				<line>BUT!  What if I switch my beliefs to foundationalism, in which I mark a few beliefs as "foundations" I consider to be "self-evident"?</line>

				<line>This means that you have to shower and if you always wake up with food on your face then you have to understand that you have a problem.  We all have problems, but yours is that you go to sleep beside bowls of wet salad and then in your sleep, you tip over the bowl.  You need to work on that.  I don't know what to tell you.</line>
				<line>Tip 2: prostate exams: apparently important?</line>
				<line>Apparently prostate exams are pretty important!</line>
				<line>Tip 3: In some situtations, like truck stops, manliness is measured by virility, so you may wish to boast of sexual conquests.  But in other situations (job interviews), it's measured by problem solving skills and your ability to work in groups!</line>
				<line>True men can easily distinguish between such situations.</line>
				<line>TIPS FOR WOMEN</line>
				<line>Attention women!  Sometimes men fall asleep next to bowls of wet salad.  I don't know what to tell you.</line>

				<line>I think that comedy goes bad after a while!  I don't think I've EVER laughed at a joke that's more than two hundred years old.</line>
				<line>Screw you, comedy!</line>
				<line>It's not just that jokes get dated, but that whole standards for comedy shift, I think.  Stuff that was edgy fifty years ago is old hat today!  We can recognize HOW it was supposed to be funny, but there's comedic writing from a hundred years ago that goes right over our heads today, simply because we don't have the cultural context to recognize that jokes are being made, that parody and satire are taking place.  Ouch for those guys!  Ouch for us in 200 years!</line>
				<line>Well, most everything changes with time, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>I guess!</line>
				<line>But I think comedy changes more than most.  We can read serious writing from centuries ago and the arguments are WAY more accessible than any jokes.</line>
				<line>I guess that's true, but I'm sure there are also "stupid people do stupid things" jokes that are pretty timeless.</line>
				<line>Oh man, I never told you!  One time, I saw a stupid guy nobody likes eating too many bananas!!</line>
				<line>Hah hah!  Why'd he do that?</line>

				<line>Okay, so perhaps there ARE those who find old jokes in old books to be hilarious, and we just happen to have different senses of humour! IT MAY HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE TO GENERALIZE ACROSS EVERY LIVING THING THAT CAN LAUGH, AND ALSO READ.</line>
				<line>This I do concede!</line>
				<line>But, I still think that it's true that, given a random joke from the present and one from the past, the average person will be more likely to laugh at the present joke, just because they have more context. I'm convinced present-day jokes about airplane food will fade in cultural relevance and become less funny as airplanes are replaced by HoverPants!</line>
				<line>Hey, nice move, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>Ah, you refer to my classy search for a middle ground!</line>
				<line>No, I meant the whole "shift the argument to the future" thing, so that nobody can disagree with you! It was smooth.</line>
				<line>Hee, it's true! It's the same argument, but since the future doesn't exist yet, nobody can really argue with me about it one way or the other!</line>

				<line>VISITING OLD FRIENDS COMICS</line>
				<line>Hooray for visiting old friends!</line>
				<line>Old friends are the best kind of friends because you still get along really well, even though you maybe haven't seen each other for a long time. It is a time for healthy nostalgia and for talking of tomorrow! </line>
				<line>But current friends are good too, aren't they T-Rex?</line>
				<line>Yes! My endorsement of old friends is not meant to be taken as a slight against friends currently in rotation.</line>
				<line>What do you like best about visiting old friends, T-Rex? </line>
				<line>An excellent question!</line>
				<line>I think what I like best is how you have the intimacy years of friendship provides, but also the perspective gained from any time spent apart. It lets you be honest with each other! You can see how everyone's changed and talk and laugh about it.</line>
				<line>That's great -  BUT WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS??</line>
				<line>Aww! Well, I'll be their friend, unless there's a good reason why they don't have any friends, such as rampant murderism or incurable stealie-o-holicism.</line>
				<line>Neither of those are actual afflictions, T-Rex!</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>HEY T-REX HOW MANY EMOTIONS ARE THERE</line>
				<line>How many emotions are there?? I can think of at least three.</line>
				<line>Desire, elation, and rage!</line>
				<line>YOUR LIST OF EMOTIONS IS A SHORT STORY HUH</line>
				<line>Yep! It's about a woman who desires something, then gets it and is pretty elated about the whole thing, but then, AFTERWARDS, she's pretty pissed.</line>
				<line>COOL</line>
				<line>I think emotions are not discrete but rather a continuum, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>I find your views interesting! Tell me more!</line>
				<line>The emotions we have in English are just labels we've applied to a SPECTRUM of feeling. You can almost always divide existing emotions into smaller, more precise chunks! For example, your well-known satisfaction at eating cereal in the morning is an exact, identifiable, reproducible joy that I can only label "breakfast pleasure."</line>
				<line>Breakfast pleasure! Finally, I have words for that most sublime of satisfactions!! BREAKFAST PLEASURE. I love breakfast pleasure.</line>
				<line>I know, T-Rex.</line>

			<panel>
				<line>Has this strapping young dinosaur perhaps become a little... COMPLACENT?</line>
				<line>It's time to go traveling!</line>
				<line>This is because travel beats complacency if you do it right!  When you're traveling as a backpacker, outside of the regular tourism industry, you're off the beaten path AND doing a lot of new things all on your own.  You meet new people and, since you're put in an environment where you're probably less comfortable than you usually are (both literally and figuratively), you're in a prime situation for self-discovery as well!</line>
				<line>So you'd rather do your own thing than go on a big tour with a travel agency?</line>
				<line>Absolutely!</line>
				<line>But - I mean, I know it's not entirely a positive thing.  All tourism can change the areas it touches!  My role as a backpacker COULD be seen as an advance scout for the larger tourism industry - and if I find something wonderful, odds are others will soon follow.</line>
				<line>So what's the solution?</line>
				<line>I don't know, man!  Stop traveling?  Encase unspoiled areas in amber?  Use spaceships to colonize new planets and therefore delay the issue until there are no new frontiers?</line>
				<line>That last one sounds pretty awesome!</line>
				<line>That's cause it's got rockets!</line>

				<line>Man, forget television, books, films, short films, to a lesser extent plays and other theatre, and the remaining popular media! They have cheapened emotion by putting it on constant display.</line>
				<line>This I do believe!</line>
				<line>Maybe "cheapened" is too strong a word, but it's now - routine? Predictable? Now if we've made a big mistake we can't say "My God! What have I done?" because it's too clich?: we either have to acknowledge that or reach for another way to express it. IN CONCLUSION AND IN SUMMARY, the highest experience life can offer us have already been acted out for us, cheapened by imitation and reference instead of experienced firsthand!</line>
				<line>Do you really feel this way?</line>
				<line>Sometimes! Especially when I get angry.</line>
				<line>It's just that - it can be hard to have a meaningful conversation when you're dancing around all these clich?s.</line>
				<line>Well, actually, that's one of the things that first attracted me to you: your ability to IGNORE popular culture, your willingness to talk as if nobody's listening.</line>

		<body>

				<line>I am writing the best story ever!  In it, I simply APPROPRIATE a popular novel, and then place its author in a generalized version of its premise!  THEN, the author has eerily familiar, but thoroughly modernized,adventures.</line>
				<line>So, it's like, H.G. Wells actually has a time machine that he uses for wacky escapades!</line>
				<line>And then he goes back in time to meet Edgar Allan Poe, who actually IS haunted by the supernatural and has a creepy raven in his study, next to the silken sad uncertain rustling of his purple curtains.  After picking up Mary Shelley, they ALL go forward in time and meet Patricia Highsmith, who is surrounded by morally compromised antihero neighbours!  Then they all go on a train ride and have an adventure.  </line>
				<line>Then what happens?</line>
				<line>THEN, my friend, the story writes itself!</line>
				<line>And at the end, all the characters high five each other and go home to their own times, promising to write their own versions of what happened.  Then, they all write their most famous works!</line>

				<line>MMORPGs are already really popular and addictive - some people play them upwards of eight hours a day.

It'll be a terribly effective way to make profits from those with addictive personalities.</line>
				<line>So people can bet in-game money to win real-life money?</line>
				<line>Yep!</line>
				<line>You'd allow bets like that, but balance it so, overall, you don't end up losing real money. The more you gamble, the better stats your characters get, and the more you play, the more chances you have to win in the casino. Both addictions encourage the other!</line>
				<line>It really is an awful idea, T-Rex!</line>

				<line>THINGS WOMEN LOVE:</line>
				<line>I know all sorts of things women love! For example: women LOVE IT when you dismiss them in arguments by saying "Whoah! This kitten's got claws!"</line>
				<line>ACTUALLY NOBODY LOVES IT WHEN YOU SAY THAT T-REX</line>
				<line>No way dude!</line>
				<line>It's hilarious! It's IRONIC, because I've never actually called a woman a "kitten", on account of how I'm not a facial hair dude from the seventies? And it also says "I understand you're upset, but not REALLY upset, because I'm willing to make a joke that's sort of at your expense, but also really at my expense too, because now I look like a sexist facial hair dude! Let's share a laugh!"</line>
				<line>There are layers upon layers!</line>
				<line>So you're using sexism ironically now!</line>
				<line>Yep! But it's not SINCERE sexism. I wouldn't say, "Whoah! This cute, somehow inferior gender's got claws!"</line>
				<line>And you'd laugh if a woman said something similar, but at the expense of men, to you.</line>

				<line>ONE TIME, I snuck onto a friend's computer while at his house and altered an essay he was writing for school about EVIL. All I did for instant hilarity was relace every instance of the word "evil" with the phrase "Irish evil"!</line>
				<line>Can good exist without Irish evil? SOME PHILOSOPHERS SUSPECT IT CANNOT!</line>
				<line>But - there's no particular flavour of Irish evil, T-Rex! It's absurd!</line>
				<line>I know! That's part of the joke: how the author seems so obsessed with examining EVERY ASPECT of his ridiculous concept of Irish evil!</line>
				<line>I would like some more examples from this prank!</line>
				<line>And I am only too happy to provide them!</line>
				<line>To see for yourself, all you have to do is go to the Wikipedia article on evil and do the replaces there. Hah hah! My comedy ONCE AGAIN trumps the desires of those who would seek useful information about evil!</line>
				<line>T-Rex! People often use Wikipedia as an important "first source". You'll confuse them so hard!</line>
				<line>LATER:</line>
				<line>It's very nice to meet you, Jimbo Wales, founder and president of Wikipedia!</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>I wonder what the most important day of my life is? Yesterday? Tomorrow? Maybe even...</line>
				<line>TODAY???</line>
				<line>It could be that I wouldn't even recognize the importance of the day until years down the line - like, if today is the day I come across an abandoned violin and ten later I discover that I'm actually seriously excellent at playing sonatas, and then I become famous for playing sonatas. That would have a huge effect on my life, and TODAY COULD BE THAT DAY. </line>
				<line>What if today really IS your most important day, and nothing memorable happens? </line>
				<line>Aw man!</line>
				<line>If that is the case, then I would be sorely disappointed. I'm serious! I would be so disappointed that I would start to get physically sore. </line>
				<line>The next morning you'd get up and say, "Ouch! I must have been disappointed a little TOO MUCH yesterday! I'll have to go easy on the disappointment for a while!"</line>
				<line>ANYWAY! T-REX'S MOST IMPORTANT DAY HAS ALREADY COME AND GONE! IT LOOKED LIKE THIS:</line>
				<line>Hello, my name is T-Rex! I'm pleased to meet you. </line>

				<line>I'm so glad I was right on this one.</line>
				<line>Do you know any Benjamins, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>Nope! I knew one when I was a kid, but he moved away way before I ever found out about jammin'. That was in - what, grade 5?</line>
				<line>THE END</line>
				<line>SPECIAL "HEY, WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BEN" SECTION: </line>
				<line>Hey, whatever happened to Ben?</line>
				<line>WELL, last I heard he was starting high school a few towns over, so I presume he went through the development process that is high school and emerged a changed, taller man than the person I remember from our halcyon pre-pubescent days.</line>

				<line>LITTERING COMICS</line>
				<line>all over the internet</line>
				<line>I've tried doing nothing, but that left me feeling like a frustrated milquetoast pushover! I keep wanting to pull the "excuse me, you dropped this" line, but it is sort of an aggressive thing to do, especially if the way I say it makes it clear I think it was, indeed, NO ACCIDENT.  I could see that leading to a confrontation, and I don't want to be that guy who throws punches over empty cans of Coke!</line>
				<line>You could throw down over disgusting used Kleenexes!</line>
				<line>But it's an overreaction, isn't it?</line>
				<line>I don't know - littering's this perfectly situated thing where it's not THAT big a deal taken individually, but a really antisocial thing when taken on a larger scale.</line>
				<line>And yet, not really, when you compare it to, say, murderin' dudes.</line>
				<line>Exaclty! I don't know how I should react when confronted with a small instance of a small crime, but which still bothers me.  All I can think of is to sneak poo bugs into the dude's food?</line>

				<line>Wouldn't that be cool, Dromiceiomimus? I think that would be cool. You could peek ahead and see every time you get into a fight, so you could be prepared!</line>
				<line>But you'd be spoiling (in the movie sense) your own life!</line>
				<line>TRUE. But, you'd also be able to see a rapid-fire montage of all the women you ever kiss. That would be neat and hopefully not disappointing!</line>
				<line>It would actually be pretty neat, I think! You could see your changing responses and everything.</line>
				<line>I know!</line>

			<panel>
				<line>LOGICAL FALLACY COMICS</line>
				<line>today's fallacy: PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM</line>
				<line>"the loaded question"</line>
				<line>A "loaded question" is when you ask a question that presupposes something unproven!</line>
				<line>For instance, Dromiceiomimus, I could ask, "Hey, Dromiceiomimus! Are you still punching children?"</line>
				<line>What? No!!</line>
				<line>Aha - so when did you stop? See what I did there? The question presupposes that you've been punching on children in the past, and goes on to suggest that maybe you're still doing so.  It is LOADED like rich uncle Pennybags.  From Monopoly?</line>
				<line>Your question is really two questions combined into one!</line>
				<line>Yep!</line>
				<line>It breaks down to "Have you ever punched children, and, if so, are you still doing so?" But since these are merged, and since this merged form still demands a yes or no answer, "no" becomes misleading.  The solution is not to answer "yes" or "no", but to reject the question!</line>
				<line>Really!</line>
				<line>T-Rex, are you still punchin' children? Are you still punching them just to steal their ice cream cones?</line>
				<line>I reject your question, Utahraptor! It's loaded!</line>

				<line>When I was a kid it was okay, because I didn't have any cultural context and didn't understand that maybe companies WANTED me to spread the word about their ads. But now that I'm a grown-up target market dude, I know that companies sometimes design ads with the express intent that I'll get excited and tell my friends! And it turns out I don't really like being manipulated for profit by strangers?</line>
				<line>So what's the solution?</line>
				<line>I don't know dude!</line>
				<line>I know I don't want to give up on getting excited about cool ads! Art can be created in a commercial context, and I don't want to reject something because of its origins. BUT I don't want to be Captain Suggestible either!</line>
				<line>Nobody wants to be Captain Suggestible!</line>
				<line>Captain Suggestible: Guys! I'm right here!</line>
				<line>I'm sorry Cap'n! You forgive me so hard.</line>
				<line>Captain Suggestible: I forgive you! I forgive you so hard!!</line>

				<line>Aw, I feel kinda bad about taking advantage of Captain Suggestible.  What do you do with someone who is that damn suggestible?</line>
				<line>Dude has his own problems!</line>
				<line>It reminds me of this friend I had in high school who could never ever detect sarcasm, no matter what.  It's such a small thing, but it would come up all the time when I'd be like, "oh, no, please, no more ketchup!" and then I wouldn't get any more ketchup when I actually wanted some more ketchup.</line>
				<line>That came up all the time?</line>
				<line>We were CRAZY DUDES in high school!!</line>
				<line>So you see Captain Suggestible as a tragic figure?</line>
				<line>Maybe!  Mostly I see elements of myself.  </line>
				<line>He's just got this big interpersonal thing where he's not quite sure what's appropriate, and because of that he transgresses unwritten societal boundaries all the time.  I think we've all done that a little, and it's embarrassing!  </line>

		<title>logical fallacy comics: the relativist fallacy</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>THE UNIVERSE WHERE EVERYTHING COMES BACK TO TOAST:</line>
				<line>So yeah, as I was saying, the relativist fallacy is when you reject a claim by saying "Oh, that may be true for you, but it's not true for me."</line>
				<line>HUH</line>
				<line>So if I say "the atomic mass of xenon is 131.3 AMU", a response of "Oh, maybe it is for YOU!" is a fallacy.  But if I said "toast is the ultimate breakfast-time treat", you could very well respond with "maybe for YOU, not for ME" and it wouldn't be a fallacy, because as we know the debate over breakfast is as subjective as it is eternal.</line>
				<line></line>
				<line>Who are you explaining the relativist fallacy to?</line>
				<line>Oh, just God!</line>
				<line>He was asking me what the weight of xenon was and I was all "Duh, 131.3 AMU" and he was all "Duh, maybe for you, T-Rex" and I was all, "Aha! Time to pontificate!" Then I worked in an example about toast.</line>
				<line>T-Rex and Utahraptor: HEY! Let's go get some toast!</line>

				<line>The Uncanny Valley is the name given to the idea that as we build robots that look more and more like real people, the more we approach a point where we all say "oh God oh God what is wrong with that robot where did it all go wrong OH GOD". </line>
				<line>This also applies to animation!</line>
				<line>The idea is that crudely-realized characters don't look like real people, but we can see some qualities of real people in them, so they're cute! But as you add more and more realism without quite reaching perfection, you reach a point where suddenly instead of cartoons that look real, they're real people who look TERRIBLY WRONG. Cuteness is replaced with the same reaction we'd have to putrid, retching, animated corpse: revulsion, and question is "Why??".</line>
				<line>But if you can make the characters look even better, you get past that!</line>
				<line>True!</line>
				<line>Hence the "valley" - you accept the creature more and more, then are suddenly repulsed, then you accept it the most.</line>
				<line>Perhaps a powerful metaphor for LOVE?</line>
				<line>Hah! I don't think I love the way you do!</line>
				<line>LATER, AT HALLOWE'EN!</line>
				<line>There! My costume looks like a failed corpse that still makes a blasphemous claim to life. Thanks, Uncanny Valley!</line>
				<line>Uncanny Valley: No problem, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>It's so upsetting that you got personified, Uncanny Valley.</line>

				<line>HOW TO ATTRACT MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITE SEX</line>
				<line>Yes! THIS is a topic I know ALL ABOUT.</line>
				<line>Okay! The first way is to draw attention to your hips!</line>
				<line>This is because women have larger more flared hips than men do, on account of secondary sexual characteristics! So all heterosexual men cannot help but find women's hips UTTERLY FASCINATING, and all heterosexual women find men's hips FLABBERGASTINGLY EROTIC.</line>
				<line>I've never really been that into hips, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>Perhaps that is because you have a case of the perversions!</line>
				<line>The second way is to draw attention to your skull!</line>
				<line>You mean face?</line>
				<line>Nope, skull! Men have heavier skulls than women, so again, men find light skulls unbelievably sexy, and women find heavy skulls ASTONISHINGLY GORGEOUS.</line>
				<line>Hah! I'll bet you five dollars we can't find even one porn site that's about heavy and light skulls.</line>

				<line>a helpful comic for machine intelligences that "just have trouble in test situations"</line>
				<line>The Turing test is a test that all emergent intelligences face at one point or another!</line>
				<line>In it, you have a REAL person engaged in a text conversation with both a person and a machine, and that person has to determine which responder is which. If the machine can appear more "alive" than the person, then they pass!</line>
				<line>And then they're officially conscious?</line>
				<line>Nope! The problem is that the test doesn't prove consciousness, just communication, and um, it can be faked.</line>
				<line>Oh man - you're going to say "brute force"! You're going to use the brute force approach!</line>
				<line>Hells yes!</line>
				<line>Since conversations don't last forever, then there's a finite number of sentences that make sense and that are at least passibly grammatical, so you can just record every possible response to every possible word combination, and kapow! Responses like a real person.</line>
				<line>Man! That's lame.</line>

				<line>The idea is that the camera is situated by and for men!</line>
				<line>Thus, we always see more of the woman's body than we do of the man's in film - the camera possesses the (heterosexual) male gaze, and thereby disenfranchises the woman by reducing her to the passive object of gaze, while the male is elevated to the active gazer. It is a NOT UNCONTROVERSIAL theory.</line>

				<line>A nice benefit of this is that free will is reduced to a complete illusion, since everything anyone ever does is already decided. On the plus side, this means that you can decide to do anything you want, because you're not responsible for it! But on the minus side, it means that you can't ever ACTUALLY decide to do anything. Thank, determinism!</line>
				<line>But come on, even if free will is an illusion, it's a convincing one!</line>
				<line>True!</line>
				<line>So who cares if everything is predetermined then? If it's utterly convincing that I have free will, what does it matter if it's all predetermined? I'm still affecting events in ways I choose.</line>
				<line>But you'd just be lying to yourself! You're affecting events, but not CHOOSING anything.</line>
				<line>Off-panel speaker: So how can I be faulted for that, T-Rex... IF IT WAS ALREADY DETERMINED THAT I'D LIE TO MYSELF?</line>
				<line>Hooray! You pass determinism.</line>
				<line>T-Rex and off-panel speaker: Now, let's never talk about it again!</line>

				<line>When you break up with someone, can you still be friends?</line>

				<line>But - what if you broke up with them because you didn't love them anymore?</line>
				<line>OKAY. But there still must be things that attracted you to them, and you can still have those as friends! Maybe they're really good at karaoke, or adept at shoe repair. That's attractive!</line>
				<line>That IS attractive!</line>
				<line>That's what I'm saying!</line>

				<line>So there's this guy I know, and he must be a friend of a friend because I see him sometimes at parties, but WE can never be friends because I find looking at him intensely frustrating.  He has the world's most punchable face!</line>
				<line>T-REX AND THE GUY WITH THE WORLD'S MOST PUNCHABLE FACE</line>
				<line>And it's terrible! It reflects poorly on me, I know, but there's just something about him that is BAD for me.  It's like being sexually attracted in reverse? I just end up avoiding the guy.  He's got a stupid face for jerks!</line>
				<line>*sigh*</line>
				<line>I guess I just can't get past my prejudice against people with stupid faces for jerks.</line>
				<line>Oh man, I knew a guy like that!</line>
				<line>Really?</line>
				<line>Yeah! We went to the same school.  He's the only guy I've ever felt that way about!</line>
				<line>I know! It's the same with me.  MY ONLY CONSOLATION is that somebody else probably thinks I, T-Rex, have a stupid face, so at least I'll get my prejudice from both sides.</line>

I, incidentally, plan to remain sane." and then there's IRONY. Shakespeare fans love irony!</line>

				<line>"Oh yeah? Well here in the REAL world, WE don't get to rest for 32 bars!"</line>
				<line>Hee hee! It's funny, Dromiceiomimus, because sometimes in a song musicians get to rest for 32 bars, while here in the real world, we don't get to do that because we're not, um - trained musicians.</line>
				<line>I got that, yeah! It seems like it would only work on a musician who's lazy though, right? Or who's insulting you about being lazy?</line>

The first year, at breakfast, the first monk speaks and says "I hate oatmeal."  A year later, again at breakfast, the second monk speaks and says "I love oatmeal."  Finally, one year later, the last monk gets to speak and HE says "I'm tired of this constant bickering about oatmeal!"</line>
				<line>Hee hee!  Comedy gold!</line>
				<line>Aw, that's an old joke!</line>
				<line>BUT A GOOD ONE!  It's funny, I think, because the conversation is spread over three years, and NORMALLY, you'd expect monks not to talk about oatmeal for that long.</line>
				<line>I think it's funny because monks are normally thought of as holy, not as oatmeal obsessed OR oatmeal loathing!</line>

		<title>A Modest Proposal: For Preventing Vandals the World Over from Being a Hilarious Burden to Wikipedia and Its Readers, and for Making Them Move Beneficial to the Stern, Encyclopaedia-Reading, Publick</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>The Problem with Wikipedia is that it's peppered with vandalism at various times and at various locations: vandalism that remains until it's noticed by someone who knows enough and cares enough to fix it!  SOMETIMES THIS CAN TAKE A WHILE. BUT!</line>
				<line>*ahem*</line>
				<line>Ladies and gentlemen: I have solved the Wikipedia Problem!</line>
				<line>The solution is as brilliant as it is awesome: instead of vandalizing the ENTIRE encyclopedia, we all just agree to vandalize one article, leaving the other ones alone! That article is the one about chickens. Why? It's pretty obvious. DUDES ALREADY KNOW ABOUT CHICKENS.</line>
				<line>In conceding that one TINY article to the vandals, Wikipedia wins! Their victory: a FULLY ACCURATE encyclopedia that covers every topic in the universe, 'cept chickens.</line>
				<line>T-Rex, this is worse than taking on the mob! Wikipedia will be HELLUVA mad at you!</line>
				<line>No way! I am doing them a FAVOUR.</line>
				<line>Their vandalism problem GOES AWAY, FOREVER, and all that I ask is that chickens become The Forbidden Topic.  "We never talk about chickens", they can say. "DON'T ASK."</line>
				<line>But how are you going to get people to respect this idea? Plus, IS IT NOT TRUE THAT MANY WIKIPEDIA EDITORS ARE TRULY HUMOURLESS ABOUT WIKIPEDIA??</line>
				<line>I guess we're about to find out! I bet Fictitional Jimbo Wales loves the idea.</line>
				<line>Fictional Jimbo Wales: I do love this idea, T-Rex!</line>

		<title>nature vs nurture vs THE INCREDIBLE HULK!!</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Something people like to argue about sometimes is whether or not certain things are genetically innate, or personal decisions!</line>
				<line>NATURE VERSUS NURTURE</line>
				<line>in comic form, baby</line>
				<line>If it's natural, then you can't really blame a person for having it, because they didn't have a choice.  But if it's because of nurture, then you CAN blame them for it, or the very least their parents!  OR SOCIETY.</line>
				<line>Is the whole nature/nurture debate really about assigning blame?</line>
				<line>I think so!  It doesn't change the "nature" (oh ho ho!) of what's being discussed, just its origin.</line>
				<line>Well, it's not just about blame or credit, T-Rex, it's also about free will!</line>
				<line>Free will?</line>
				<line>Yeah, because if something important about you is fully determined by your genes, then you never had any control over that, and you're not responsible.  You didn't have a choice.  On the other hand, if you think babies are born as blank slates, then that's limitless personal freedom, but that has problems too!</line>
				<line>GUYS THERE IS A THIRD OPTION</line>
				<line>What's that?  GOD wanted it to be that way?</line>
				<line>I WAS GONNA SAY LEPRECHAUNS BUT YEAH</line>
				<line>DANG</line>

		<title>the great thing about duplicator rays is that they're REALLY easy to manufacture, once you've made the first one!  or two, if you don't have a mirror.  what could possibly go wrong</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Literally hours of work have paid off, and I have come up with my greatest invention yet...a DUPLICATOR RAY!</line>
				<line>(Duplicator rays let you make perfect copies of anything!)</line>
				<line>Really?  So if I have, say, a papier-m?ch? pi?ata dog filled with tasty candies, your duplicator ray will make a PERFECT duplicate?</line>
				<line>Yep!  The duplicate is identical in every regard.  The ray examines the object at the quantum AND subquantum levels and thanks to the twin fists of Actual Science and Heisenberg Compensators, makes a perfect copy, indistinguishable from the original!</line>
				<line>I call baloney, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>Aha! On account of how it violates conservation of energy laws?</line>
				<line>Nope, on account of how it's truly impossible to have a perfect copy of anything!  Philosophically: if I paint a picture and you duplicate it, I'll grant that they can be identical in every way BUT ONE: mine is the original.  That's a property that doesn't have a physical realization, so you can't ever duplicate it!</line>
				<line>Okay YEAH it's not original, but it's an OTHERWISE PERFECT DUPLICATE.  I can destroy economies based on scarcity and generate clean drinking water for everyone!  I can even DUPLICATE DUDES!  I can't believe you're not more excited.  I CAN DUPLICATE BRENT SPINER</line>

				<line>Ladies and gentlemen: is it time for a new catchphrase?</line>
				<line>Sources say: "DAMN girl, sure is!"</line>
				<line>That's not the new catchphrase though. I've got - I've got different ones. And here they are! "Let's get remarkably frisky" (useful in many situations), "That's gobbles!" (meaning "that's crazy!", short for 'gobbledygook'), and "I lose at sex".</line>
				<line>Um.</line>
				<line>You can use "I lose at sex" for when you lose at sex.</line>
				<line>Um.</line>
				<line>What's this "lose at sex" thing all about?</line>
				<line>Losing at sex! Dude! It's right there.</line>
				<line>It's like when people say "You lose at life", only better because it's more specific and also suggests that sex is not a competition, but that you found a way of making it one, and then, you lost at it. It's "the gobbles"?</line>

		<title>it's called a negative income tax because instead of bottoming out at you owing the government $0, it can become negative, so the government can owe you money.  that's right!  taxes, bitches!</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>A negative income tax, or "NIT", is when the government pays you money when your income is low! Pretty sweet!</line>
				<line>NEGATIVE INCOME TAX COMICS</line>
				<line>it will be interesting I PROMISE</line>
				<line>But there is a catch. You still pay taxes - say, a flat tax of 10% - BUT, the government also pays you enough to survive! This way there's a guaranteed minimum income - like welfare, but simpler. So if you make only $1000 in a year you'll pay $100 in taxes, but since the government pays everyone, say, $10000, you'll end up $9900 ahead in tax money. As you make more money, you net less from the government, until you end up actually paying taxes!</line>
				<line>So this acts to replace welfare?</line>
				<line>Yep! And a bunch of related programs.</line>
				<line>It simplifies things, plus it includes a flat tax, which a lot of amateur economists AS WELL AS even some real economists like!</line>
				<line>I can see fraud being a problem, though, especially since if the fraud's successful, the government loses real money.</line>
				<line>LATER:</line>
				<line>Utahraptor! I just found out that Milton Friedman, proposer of the NIT, died yesterday at age 94!</line>

				<line>I do think "nuts" can be applied to chocolate bars though.</line>

				<line>KISS THE FIRST: one time i was SERIOUSLY kissing a lady and thought of how bad it would be if I started laughing right then, and the image of her being so PISSED at me was so funny that I laughed right into her mouth! 16 months later, we broke up. COINCIDENCE??</line>
				<line>Hey! You've laughed in my mouth too!</line>
				<line>Don't try to change me, baby!</line>
				<line>KISS THE SECOND: one time I kissed a woman who just threw up?</line>
				<line>Ewwwwwwww!</line>
				<line>Well I didn't KNOW she'd just thrown up! She tried to warn me.</line>
				<line>What'd she say?</line>
				<line>"Wait, I just threw - ", and then we were smoochin'! I THOUGHT she was going to say, "...out all doubts I had about our kissing in the near future."</line>

				<line>I am a dude with some SERIOUSLY UNINFORMED opinions about archaeology!</line>
				<line>Okay! We're digging up stuff all the time, right? And talk to any archaeologist and they'll complain about sites that have been damaged or destroyed by under-informed Victorian archaeologists that didn't have the knowledge and skills we have today. Doesn't it stand to reason that in 100 years we'll be making the same complaints about today's work? We only have so much history. Shouldn't we wait until we've perfected archaeology before we dig?</line>
				<line>Well, doctors don't wait until medical technology is at a peak before operating!</line>
				<line>True!</line>
				<line>But dudes and ladies have finite lifetimes. The past isn't going anywhere! We can dig it up whenevs.</line>
				<line>Perhaps it's only through excavation that archaeologists learn how to better their trade.</line>

				<line>INFORMED OPINIONS ABOUT ARCHAEOLOGY COMICS</line>
				<line>Yes! I have actually done some research this time. Schwing!</line>
				<line>And it turns out I was TOTALLY CORRECT!</line>
				<line>Archaeologists ARE aware that they're mining a finite resource, and when possible, they only dig a little and leave some for the future. But there are time limits: often they'll be examining a site just before it's dug up for a new building of something, which means this is their last chance to see what's there before it's destroyed. And sometimes the ground is volatile enough that if they don't dig soon, whatever's there will be lost anyway!</line>
				<line>In conclusion and in summary, way to go archaeologists!</line>
				<line>Hooray for archaeologists!</line>
				<line>T-Rex and Utahraptor: We have nothing but good things to say about the women and men of archaeology! Nothing but smiles for the trained and capable few who dedicate themselves towards exploring and explaining our shared history!</line>

				<line>THERE IS NO CHOICE IN THIS MATTER</line>
				<line>RESOLUTION ONE:</line>
				<line>eat less chickens!</line>
				<line>I mean, eat FEWER chickens. "Fewer" is when you can count them, and "less" is when it's more of a mass and less countable, right? Like, I'd eat less rice, but I'd eat fewer COUNTABLY-MANY grains of rice.</line>
				<line>I think you should resolve to be less obsessed about grammar!</line>
				<line>Oh, Dromiceiomimus. Denied!!</line>
				<line>So let's hear these other resolutions!</line>
				<line>Of course! AFTER we talk about "less" and "fewer".</line>
				<line>Isn't it neat that we have this distinction in English between fewer and elss, but the opposite, "more", covers both those cases? Our language is ASYMMETRICAL. If you want to encode countability in your "greater than" comparison word, then good luck! Hah! GOOD LUCK WITH THAT, MY FRIEND!</line>

				<line>Sweet! Okay, so the idea is, there's this guy, Lee, right? One day he gains SUPER POWERS. And I'm not sure how he gets them yet but BASICALLY he's got this slot in the top of his head, and he can write words on cards and put them in the slot, so he gains those qualities! So say a decision has to be made: he writes "decisive" on a card and forces it into his head, and he becomes DECISIVE LEE! He then has the power to do things decisively, SUPER decisively!</line>
				<line>So he's got any power that can be described by an English adverb ending in "ly"?</line>
				<line>PRECISELY!</line>
				<line>But not just Precise Lee, he can be Compelling Lee, Obliging Lee - even Furious Lee! But the catch is, the cards stick out, so enemies know what they're dealing with. "Oh cool, we're dealing with Conclusive Lee", they'll say. "We can ask him some questions."</line>

Then the bite kills you and you come back as a zombie. But zombies WANT to eat you! It's only the sucky ones that bite you and don't finish the job. So if the first zombie was REALLY GOOD, the infection wouldn't spread, because he'd cold eat all his victims! And if he was sucky you could just avoid him, on account of his suckiness.</line>
				<line>PROBLEM: SOLVED.</line>
				<line>You're coming from a medical perspective, right?</line>
				<line>The idea is that there's not too many diseases that can spread easily AND kill you overnight, because they're too effective: the infection wouldn't spread, and the disease dies.</line>

				<line>I have discovered the ultimate secret to comedy! The more obscure a joke is, the less people there are who'll get it, but the MORE they'll find it correspondingly HILARIOUS! I suspect this law progresses geometrically.</line>
				<line>For example!</line>
				<line>Let's say I have a joke about how cats like to sleep. NOT FUNNY, right Dromiceiomimus? Everyone who's met a sleepy ol' cat can get that. But if I have a joke about how, say, an obscure programming language is pretty wacky, then people who know that language will feel like I'm talking to them! They laugh both at the joke AND in recognition. Comedy increases, and the only reasonable conclusion is "laughs ahoy!"</line>
				<line>So logically, ALL I HAVE TO DO is find a really rich guy and tell him a joke only HE'D find funny, and I'm set for life!</line>
				<line>Huh?</line>
				<line>Dude, rich people LOVE to give people money when they make them laugh! And I'm going to track down Patrick Stewart and make him laugh SO HARD. You don't even know.</line>

				<line>But T-Rex - photons don't have any mass, do they?  If they had mass, wouldn't that mean that walking outside on a sunny day would mean being hit with trillions of tiny bullets, reducing everything to a red, pulpy, well-lit paste?</line>
				<line>But then how do solar sails work?  And photon engines?  Don't they work by photons pushing against things?  HAS SCIENCE FICTION BEEN LYING THROUGH ITS SCIENCE TEETH?</line>

				<line>It's neat how most of our key verbs are just one syllable long! I think that verbs we use a lot change to short words with time, since if they did NOT, it would take a real long time to say all the run-of-the-mill thoughts we have!</line>
				<line>We'd get bored each time we'd try to talk!</line>
				<line>Sex! Love! Hate! BONE. All are rad AND short verbs! I bet you could use just short WORDS and find it to be not that hard of a trick!</line>
				<line>You might end up with an odd phrase or two, though, since you'd have to steer clear of all 'ing' verbs.</line>
				<line>Well, that verb form is for chumps! I said it! That verb form is for true chumps.</line>
				<line>Do you have some sort of proof for this "short means key" view?</line>
				<line>In fact I do!</line>
				<line>There's a set store of short words, right? A hoard, if you will. If we used all the short word forms for weird and rare verbs, like, I don't know, "to eat a lot of pork", then it would take a long time to share a thought that did not come down to "Dudes! I want to eat pigs!"</line>

				<line>Apparently, dude!</line>
				<line>But saying a word is just generating a sound wave, right? I could record myself twice saying different things, and then superimpose their waves to get a new one! Then all I'd need to do is train myself to produce THAT wave and it would sound like I'm saying two things at once! I could even do it by rote. Then when people ask me to do things I could say "yes" and "no" at the same time, and then they'd probably dislike me a little. </line>

				<line>THE STORY OF GEORGE MALLORY AND ANDREW IRVINE (INCREDIBLE TRUE PART)</line>
				<line>Their last sighting was just a few hundred metres from the summit.  They never made it back!  A STANDARD MOUNTAINEERING TALE, except that if they had made it to the top, they'd have been the first, AND they were carrying cameras.  If we could find the frozen cameras we could still retrieve images from them today, and then we'd know if they actually did make it to the top, since who climbs Mount Everest and doesn't take a picture?  NOBODY, that's who.</line>
				<line>Didn't other climbers find the bodies?</line>
				<line>Only one!</line>
				<line>Mallory's body was found 75 years later, but no cameras were on him.  Irvine's body is still up there somewhere, maybe with the cameras!</line>
				<line>Wow.  There's something so spooky and sad about their bodies being frozen like that.  It's like a treasure hunt with a perfectly preserved corpse at the end.</line>
				<line>WILD SPECULATION PART:</line>
				<line>Speculation Text: Could all "mountaineering accidents" be the handiwork of a lone, crazed murderer, loose about the peak?  IT COULD BE TRUE!!  If so, no-one has survived their encounter with the pushy "Everest Eliminator" and lived to tell the tale.</line>

				<line>SO AWESOME</line>
				<line>FROM MORRIS'S PERSPECTIVE!</line>
				<line>Morris: oh shucks i dunno t-rex i think that maybe one bible is just enough for me, since i never even read the first one! i tried really hard twice, two times, but the words were so big and i was so small and i thought "how am i gonna get all those big words into my head?" so it was real confusing, a real pickle, you know?  but then my mom came home and it turned out that i didn't even have a bible! i had a cookbook under my pillow the whole time, and all i memorized was how to cook professional enchiladas</line>

				<line>I just realized that no women have ever been to the moon! ONLY DUDES. DUDES WHO RETURNED AS MEN.</line>
				<line>Apparently, you need a sausage to get on the moon!</line>
				<line>Wait - that's actually correct, isn't it? The moon totally IS an old boys' club!</line>
				<line>Yep! I know we're being sensationalistic here, since there's only been thirteen people on the moon EVER, and that's a pretty small sample size. But still! No women! No grandmothers! NO SULLEN TEENS (FEMALE). Just men!</line>
				<line>Also: no asians?</line>
				<line>Is there a reason why all the Apollo missions were crewed by dudes?</line>
				<line>Um, it was the 60s?</line>
				<line>I guess! And I guess you could make an argument for "sexy is distracting, ON THE MOON." But sexy is distracting everywhere! You know?</line>
				<line>I suppose this legacy of sexism will be with us until we, as a people, finally return to the moon with chicks.</line>
				<line>SOON:</line>
				<line>Excuse me, sir! Would you like to buy a button that reads "RETURN TO THE MOON AND DON'T FORGET THE CHICKS THIS TIME"?</line>

				<line>HOW TO GET MARRIED</line>
				<line>a comic for people who are way into getting married</line>
				<line>If you want to get married then first you need to find a mate! You need to find a LIFE PARTNER.</line>
				<line>Once you have that partner, then ALL YOU HAVE TO DO is commit to them for the rest of your life, and they to you! It's really that easy! It's like buying a Game Boy, opening it up, and then saying, "Yes, this is enough. I will never get tired of Tetris."</line>
				<line>ALSO, the Game Boy loves you back.</line>
				<line>Aaand you're not allowed to loan the Game Boy out to friends unless you and the Game Boy talk about it first.</line>
				<line>I really don't see why you're forcing a Game Boy into this, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor! It's an analogy.</line>
				<line>Yeah, but it's ridiculous! This is you: "Marriage is like Game Boys, only you marry the Game Boys."</line>
				<line>Yes, that is a fair and accurate impression of me and my awesome desription of marriage.</line>
				<line>But don't you see? By casting marriage in terms of Game Boys, I make it seem accessible, fun, affordable, and sexy!</line>
				<line>Game Boys are like 15 years old!</line>
				<line>THEY ARE 18 YEARS OLD THIS YEAR FOR YOUR INFORMATION</line>

				<line>I was going to write a science fiction story, but then I stopped.  I realized I don't know what science fiction, as a genre, means!</line>
				<line>Seriously!  I had some DOUBTS.</line>
				<line>If I was writing a western I could go on and on about order versus freedom, civilization versus the wilderness, the hero as a man stuck between these two worlds, and so on!  But what's science fiction about?  Is it just literature with space ships and robots and casually inverted flux variance?  Aliens stopped being parallels for The Other long ago, didn't they?</line>
				<line>Why are you worried about this, T-Rex?  It's just a genre label!</line>
				<line>So?</line>
				<line>So - it's something that's applied to your work after it's completed.  Unless you want to write specifically to a generic form, you don't have to worry about it!</line>

				<line>Eww! How did that ever happen!</line>
				<line>I was experimenting with mixing juice with a blender, and I guess there was a ladybug in the blender?

				<line>So - did you drink the juice!</line>
				<line>No! Of course not!</line>

		<title>friends and neighbours, yes, i hypothesize a universe in which superman is real and dinosaurs didn't die out.  IT MAY WELL BE THE GREATEST UNIVERSE EVER</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>The essential problem with Superman, as a character, is that he's too powerful and incorruptible.  He's a walking deus ex machina! You give him a foe he can't beat, and all he has to do is TRY HARDER, and then he beats the guy.</line>
				<line>What I'm saying is that this is not truly satisfying!</line>
				<line>The way to make Supes interesting is to put him up against a problem that he can't fix by punching someone through a building! Put him in a situation where, say, everyone he loves starts dying of a disease that he can't detect or cure, passing away in his arms, one by one.  At the end he's left as the sole survivor of the doomed planet Earth, six billion dead - only this time, he had a chance to stop the disaster, and he FAILED.</line>
				<line>That's a terrible story, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>It's modern, AND dark!</line>
				<line>Yeah, and it destroys the character! Superman is a symbol of hope, and you have him basically standing up and shouting "HOPE IS USELESS AGAINST A SUPERIOR FOE" and then everyone Earth dies.</line>
				<line>I bet if Superman were real he'd like my story. He'd say to me, "That was a SUPER interesting story, T-Rex!"</line>
				<line>MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE SUPERMAN IS REAL!</line>
				<line>Superman! If I jump off this building will you save me?</line>

				<line>Back to my amazing story, "#8220;Tuqqy the Tugboat Tugs... In Space!"#8221; It"#8217;s about a NON-ANTHROPOMORPHIZED tugboat who tugs, in space. His windshield does not double as eyes. Tugboats are not like that.</line>
				<line></line>
				<line>In any case, one day a killer asteroid is discovered headed straight for Earth! </line>
				<line>Tuggy"#8217;s our only chance "#8212; our last, best hope for survival. All of our tomorrows ride on the non-anthropomorphic shoulders of one Tuggy T. Tugboat, in space! Will he be able to do it? Will he be able to save us all and become our greatest hero? </line>
				<line>I don"#8217;t get why you keep insisting Tuggy isn"#8217;t anthropomorphized, but you live him volition. Is he a robot tugboat or something? </line>
				<line>He is just a regular tugboat,  Dromiceiomimus. </line>
				<line>Ultraraptor: So what"#8217;s he doing in space?</line>
				<line>Character development</line>
				<line></line>
				<line>Ultraraptor: No, I mean, how does a tugboat end up in orbit? Your readers will want to know this! How does he move? Are his compartments pressurized? </line>
				<line>Look at you, Mr. "#8220;I can"#8217;t suspend my disbelief for a SPACE TUGBOAT named "#8216;Tuggy"#8217;"#8221;! He moves by pushing against the aether, okay? </line>
				<line>Ultraraptor: Well look at YOU, Mr. "#8220;I write a book about a tugboat that employs superseded scientific theories for locomotion"#8221;! </line>
				<line>Yes! Look at me! Look at me and buy my story and find out if Tuggy saves us all! </line>
				<line>The answer is Yes</line>

				<line>I get that it's celebrating the UNIVERSAL CONSTANT PI, and that it's celebrated today because 3.14159 can be translated into Mach 14th, 1:59. But what makes pi so special? Why don't we celebrate Euler's Number day on... February 71st?</line>
				<line>Some people celebrate "Pi Approximation Day" on July 22nd, which is 22/7.</line>

				<line>(It was seriously awesome!)</line>
				<line>And time was it was a necessary feature of every great movie - just like car chases are today!  You could go into a theatre and be GUARANTEED the slap across the face / smooch on the lips combo, SOMETIMES even before the opening credits were over.  It was good times!  I like the car chases, of course, but I miss the nuance of the old topos.  Great actors would bring such subtlety to the face slap - such pathos to the ensuing makeouts!</line>
				<line>I missed the "car chases are necessary in every great movie today" memo!</line>
				<line>Necessary AND sufficient!</line>
				<line>And like I said, they're fantastic, but they don't lend themselves to the smooches.  Today's actors COULD yell at each other and then make out during a car chase, but they never do.</line>

				<line>Sure am!</line>
				<line>The acidic and anaerobic bog water will preserve and tan my soft tissues, while dissolving the calcium in my bones! The end result is that thousands of years later, someone will find my body, still posed as I requested it, just a little floppy because there's no skeleton holding me up. THIS IS HOW I WANNA SPEND ETERNITY. Also, posed giving a Fonzie-style double thumbs up and holding a sign that says "Dudes, What's Shakin'."</line>
				<line>Will the sign be preserved?</line>
				<line>Probably! If not, we can make it out of soft tissues.</line>
				<line>So you want to die and be posed holding a sign MADE OUT OF SKIN, and all the sign says is "Dudes, What's Shakin'" and there's not even a question mark.</line>

				<line>Anachronism is when you have technology being used before it was invented!  It happens whenever Shakespeare listens to his MP3s.</line>
				<line>LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS</line>
				<line>today's technique: ANACHRONISM</line>
				<line>Ah, anachronism!  It can also happen by accident, like when an author forgets that people didn't write with ballpoint pens 100 years ago or that elves didn't have friggin' computers.  Sometimes if it's a really obvious error it can be played for comedy.</line>
				<line>It is an advanced literary technique used by only our most handsome authors!</line>
				<line>So when someone has a time machine, is that anachronism?</line>
				<line>Unfortunately, no!</line>
				<line>Time machines are a special case.  If there is a time machine in the story then a lot of anachronism can be explained by the time machine, and is thus NO LONGER ANACHRONISM.</line>
				<line>I like that this is the one literary technique that has allowances for time travel.</line>
				<line>Yeah.  It's the best.</line>

		<title>if the house or car were speaking in panel three, then one could reasonably argue that there was some anthropomorphism occuring in Dinosaur Comics</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Anthropomorphism is when you have things that normally can't talk walking around and behaving like people!  It happens whenever a toaster flips you off.</line>
				<line>LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS</line>
				<line>today's technique: ANTHROPOMORPHISM</line>
				<line>Anthropomorphism is often used in childrens' stories where you have talking animals, but can also be used in more adult works!  This is because occasionally adults enjoy it when a cat is sassy.  Sometimes, a character will be anthropomorphized by mistake, like when you write a play and accidentally attribute dialogue to a ceiling tile.  The ceiling tile is said to be "anthropomorphized" if the oversight is not corrected in a timely fashion.</line>
				<line>We all know what anthropomorphism is, dude!</line>
				<line>Aw man, really?</line>
				<line>Yep! We've actually talked about it before, remember?  But - you know, thanks for the reminder!</line>
				<line>Well, you're welcome!  Anytime you need anthropomorphism explained, just drop me a line.</line>
				<line>Gotcha.</line>

		<title>understanding ethical relativism</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>I feel that I know what's best for me, and I have no right to judge your beliefs.</line>
				<line>All beliefs and ethics are "relative"!</line>
				<line>UNDERSTANDING ETHICAL RELATIVISM</line>
				<line>I stomp this house because I feel it would be a good idea to do so! Do not judge me, Dromiceiomimus!</line>
				<line>But I believe it is wrong! Which of us is right?</line>
				<line>That is the beauty of relativism: we both are!</line>
				<line>Ethical relativism is the best philosophy ever!</line>
				<line>Oh really?!</line>
				<line>It can be argued that in every rational person (the definition of 'rational' is a touchy subject I won't discuss here) there are certain properties common to all. The problem (well, one problem) with relativism is how it nihilistically privileges the experience of the individual above all else, making every ethical decision the right ethical decision: who would not like to have his or her beliefs guaranteed to be as correct as anybody else's? But this is done at the cost of ignoring our shared qualities, turning away from the fact that despite different languages and cultures (and continents and skin colours) we all believe some of the same things. With that striking fundamental truth removed, the baby-rapers and the saints stand side by side, equals in righteousness.</line>
				<line>But your first assumption is flawed! I doubt you can find even one universal constant; even your revealing example of baby-rape is practiced by some! Granted, these people are considered" monsters", but isn't that just a case of the majority condemning a minority? I don't mean to justify baby-rape, but only to point out that it's unlikely you can come up with even one belief that is universal!</line>

				<line>Allusion is a reference to a person, place, or thing in a piece of literature!  Like when Picard mentions Moby Dick in Star Trek: First Contact?</line>
				<line>LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS</line>
				<line>today's technique:</line>
				<line>ALLUSION</line>
				<line>Allusions are pretty handy because they allow you to summarize potentially complex ideas with one succinct reference, essentially piggybacking on the brilliance of previously established works!  HOWEVER, if the audience isn't familiar with the reference, the alluson fails and can seem weird or out-of-place.</line>
				<line>Just like Oliver Brackenbury!!</line>
				<line>T-Rex and Dromiceiomimus: Hah hah hah!</line>
				<line>You sure have been summarizing literary techniques a lot lately!</line>

				<line>In CONCLUSION, anachronism, anthropomorphism and allusion are the only three literary techniques! There aren't any others. Okay there were some others but they died.</line>
				<line>LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS</line>
				<line>today's technique:</line>
				<line>ALL THE REST</line>
				<line>But what about foreshadowing? Denouement? SYNECDOCHE?</line>
				<line>All dead! Today's readers yawn in the face of foreshadowing! They wince when seeing ANY events that occur after the climax! They throw up a little when a part is used to represent the whole! You can tell when that's happened because you'll go to the library and hear "Synedoche?! bleggh"</line>
				<line>That's ridiculous! People use synecdoche all the time.</line>
				<line>People throw up all the time too!</line>

				<line>T-REX LOVES OUT-OF-GENRE COVER SONGS</line>
				<line>they're great</line>

I don't know why all music is apparently produced originally in the wrong genre as the one nature intended, but I accept it, and thank those artists bold enough to see beyond the limits of generic form!</line>

				<line>That's part of it, true!</line>

				<line>: Here's one: try being nice to him, even if you're having a bad day!</line>
				<line>Solid!</line>
				<line>Finally, experiment with remembering your man's interests!  That way, when a gift is called for, you can look for one that dovetails nicely with his interests.  He won't forget it!</line>
				<line>Wow!  I personally don't see how and relationship can fail with these sure-fire tips.</line>
				<line>I agree!  I would say that if the relationship is failing despite these tips, then you and your man may have insurmountable, fundamental differences, even if you love each other more than you can say.  Nothing is meant to last forever ladies!</line>

				<line>Dudes: that is correct!</line>
				<line>I have used my "in" with the ladies to spread around some tips!</line>
				<line>I told them that we like birthdays and cool presents and when they are nice.  Now chicks will know what we like!  I know there are some men out there who would have preferred I'd given more SALACIOUS tips, like "how to please man in the milieu of the bed-room", but that is ridiculous.  Here is how you please a man in the milieu of the bed-room: I DUNNO, MAYBE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WILL DO THE TRICK??</line>
				<line>Man, that's reverse sexism!</line>
				<line>Nope, just regular sexism!</line>
				<line>Okay but still, it's spreading the idea that all men care about is sex and that they're unable or unwilling to distinguish between sex good and bad.</line>
				<line>It's a joke that plays off gender stereotypes!  Here, I'll prove it via the scientific method... OF ASKING RANDOM MEN WHAT THEY THINK!</line>

				<line>I have a brilliant idea for revenging myself against TV's Kelsey Grammer. Oh yes.</line>
				<line>THE REVENGE OF T-REX</line>
				<line>All I have to do is put out a major motion picture and include in it a brilliant role for Kelsey. It will be a dazzling, moving role, but will also play to his type as a smart yet sassy older man. It'll be a role that screams "Kelsey Grammer": a touchstone that defines a generation - and a career. I'll even name the character "Kelsey G"! THEN, I'm gonna just go ahead and give it to somebody else. SORRY, KELSEY! TOO BAD FOR YOU THERE, HUH?</line>
				<line>What'd Kelsey ever do to you, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>Nothing! He seems like a nice guy!</line>
				<line>Ah, so this is a "just in case" revenge plan. For Kelsey Grammer.</line>

				<line>You believe you're totally fake!</line>
				<line>You're just a sustained figment of everyone else's imagination. The only issue with THAT is how everyone is imagining the same dude at the same time so well.</line>

				<line>Yes!</line>
				<line>If you buy into solipsism, then what are the odds you're the chosen one? Maybe there's some actual solipsist who really IS the only real thing going, and they're imagining everything for you, even when you're not around. What a card, huh? What a crazy dude!</line>
				<line>That's what I'm saying!</line>
				<line>If you believe one person can imagine a universe, you have to believe they can imagine your thoughts too, and then you've got no reason to believe you're real!</line>

				<line>Similar to antisolipsism but ACTUALLY REAL is the Cotard Delusion, in which the person affected believes they have died.</line>
				<line>So it goes!</line>
				<line>The condition was first identified over 100 years ago. This is UNFORTUNATE, because it was identified before the proper nomenclature was in place. It should've been called :I Think I Might Be A Zombieitis."</line>

				<line>I hear you, man!</line>
				<line>Anyway, it doesn't necessarily claim that drywall spends its time writing poems about, you know, DRYWALL STUFF - it only claims that there are some elements of sentience in everything.

				<line>Yikes!</line>
				<line>Some panpsychists go further than that though!</line>
				<line>Oh yeah?</line>
				<line>Yeah: at the extreme, you have panpsychists who believe that the entire universe possesses a single mind, and that everything, including us, is a part of it.</line>

		<title>magic realism is where you tell a realistic story but then have the characters turn each other into frogs for a bit.  depressive realism is different.</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Depressive realism is the theory that depressed people have a more accurate view of the world than the non depressed. It started when psychologists experimented with some regular chicks and dudes AND some depressed chicks and dudes.</line>
				<line>That's how these things always start!!</line>
				<line>Anyway, they put them in a room with a button and a lightbulb. The light turned on and off regardless of when the button was pressed, and the participants who were depressed were more likely to conclude that they weren't in control of the light! The non-depressed people DELUDED THEMSELVES into thinking they had more influence. The popular conclusion was that depressed people saw things more realistically!</line>
				<line>That's a pretty strong conclusion!</line>
				<line>Sure is!</line>
				<line>And it turns out that the effect only shows up in specific trivial situations! But it's a popular idea. I think some people just like the idea that depression might be an advantage!</line>
				<line>ESPECIALLY depressed people.</line>
				<line>But not TOO much, because then they wouldn't be depressed anymore!</line>
				<line>AT THE PARK:</line>
				<line>Excuse me, sir, you look depressed! Would you say you have a more accurate view of the world?</line>

				<line>Okay okay - so there's been a lot of people born, right? In the history of time there are a lot of people who have been born. So the question is, are there enough people in the world that I could write out a story...</line>
				<line>... and reasonably expect it to have already been LIVED OUT in real life?</line>
				<line>Let's assume narratives can be reduced to yes/no decisions, and on average real people make a yes/no decision every 15 seconds. Two people are needed to cover each option for every decision! So after - um, 33 decisions, we've got more people needed than are alive now, and we're only eight minutes into our story. It is a stories-in-real-life disaster!</line>
				<line>BUT, if I wrote a story about the first eight minutes of a baby's life, ODDS ARE someone has lived it!</line>
				<line>Not really!</line>
				<line>You're assuming that for each decision, every person takes a separate route, but the vast majority of babies are doing the same thing: crying and then being confused.</line>

		<title>in today's comic, a dinosaur tells off shakespeare for not agreeing with him about foreshadowing!  now if todd goldman puts that on a t-shirt, you'll know where he stole it from</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Foreshadowing is when you hint at what's about to happen next in a story! It happens whenever a character announces "BOY I SURE HOPE THERE ARE NO EXPLOSIONS ON THE NEXT PAGE!!" just before he gets blown up!</line>
				<line>In an EXPLOSION!</line>
				<line>LITERARY TECHNIQUES COMICS</line>
				<line>today's technique: FORESHADOWING</line>
				<line>Foreshadowing's great, because sometimes people want to know what happens in a story before it actually happens. In situations like this, an author might write "Jenn realized that she was about to blast into space. Or WAS she?? You'd better keep reading, huh?" There, foreshadowing both hinted at the future of the story, AND encouraged the reader to keep reading. This is an extremely canonical use of foreshadowing.</line>
				<line>So doubt's important to foreshadowing?</line>
				<line>Absolutely!</line>
				<line>If you simply say "Jenn realized that she was about to blast into space! Seconds later, she blasted into space!" that is not foreshadowing. That is just outstanding space storytelling.</line>
				<line>I think it's still foreshadowing.</line>
				<line>Yeah? Well maybe we'll see what SHAKESPEARE has to say...!</line>
				<line>MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND!</line>
				<line>Shakespeare, is it still foreshadowing if it's about a woman who's DEFINITELY blasting into space?</line>
				<line>Shakespeare: i dunno... yes?</line>

				<line>Futurism was an art movement where dudes were all "CARS ARE COOL AND THE PAST IS FOR CHUMPS. LET'S DRAW SOME CARS."</line>
				<line>FUTURISM COMICS</line>
				<line>But they also extended beyond art, to food! Futurists had a MANIFESTO for food. It banned the knife and fork and pasta, AND told people that sardines and pineapples together were tasty times! They banned pasta because it caused skepticism?</line>
				<line>Was the food good?</line>
				<line>Maybe? But it wasn't very popular.</line>
				<line>People were more into the art!</line>
				<line>Yep!</line>
				<line>They didn't want to have to eat their food under UV lamps which "activated" it, nor did they want to give up pasta.  It's crazy! The movement started in Italy, and I believe people canonically eat pasta there all the time! Like, even for breakfast?</line>
				<line>I believe that to be Italian Canon, yes.</line>

				<line>HOW CAN YOU GET MORE PEOPLE READING COMICS T-REX</line>
				<line>I don't know, God!</line>
				<line>...Maybe by making them more awesome?</line>
				<line>THAT'S YOUR ANSWER TO EVERYTHING T-REX BUT COMICS ARE ALREADY EXCEPTIONALLY AWESOME</line>
				<line>This is true! I guess they still have a stigma attached to them, though, you know? The whole "comics are for emotionally stunted shutins" thing, which, WHILE TRUE, is misleading because comics are for everyone, INCLUDING emotionally stunted shutins! People just need to focus on the positive.</line>
				<line>So your ad campaign would be "Forget stereotypes: comics are rad!"?</line>
				<line>Maybe!</line>
				<line>I was thinking more "You know who reads comics? HORRIBLE MURDERERS." and then a picture of a horrible murderer, you know, maybe murderin' something, and THEN, in tiny letters, "and also you, hopefully!" and then maybe a line drawing of a soggy dog giving a thumbs up.</line>
				<line>Wow.</line>

				<line>I do kinda feel like I should ALREADY know the answer to "do you want to get married someday", you know, Dromiceiomimus?  Its such a big thing -- you're sharing your LIFE with someone!  Until you DIE! -- that saying "if it happened it'd be nice, but no worries!" seems - disingenuous?</line>
				<line>I guess!  I know I'd like to get married someday.</line>
				<line>I'm not ruling it out!</line>
				<line>You're not committing to it either!</line>
				<line>I guess love and the artifacts of affection are so played up in our society that by being noncommittal to its (arguably) greatest expression, marriage, I avoid tacitly endorsing the commercialization of an emotion and the industry surrounding it!</line>
				<line>Perhaps!</line>
				<line>Or perhaps I don't want to say "I WANT TO GET MARRIED SOMEDAY" because if I never meet someone then I've FAILED at a life plan.  Much better to say "I WANT TO GET INTO A BOAT SOMEDAY" and then just sit in some dude's boat!  IN FACT, I'm going to the docks right now!</line>

				<line>What made him so jerky, T-Rex? His haircut?</line>
				<line>Worse than that. He was just so smug about everything! I wanted to buy some RAM, so that my computer could think harder about things? But he had this air of - distain, I guess, that went far beyond "aloof store clerk" to "terrible person who made me feel bad about myself for just being alive." I bought the RAM but now I can barely even enjoy it.</line>
				<line>Well, you're done with him now!</line>
				<line>I know! And I won't shop there again.</line>
				<line>But this is the power of his jerkiness: it transcends our brief meeting so that now I'm telling all my friends about it! Argh! Anyway, I'll get over it.</line>
				<line>Okay.</line>

				<line>FACTUAL ISSUES.</line>

				<line>&lt;&lt;BOOM..&gt;&gt;</line>

				<line>HE COULD JUST SHRINK ALL HIS ATOMS, WHICH IS RIDICULOUS. ATOMS CAN'T DO THAT.</line>
				<line>[[The man looks worriedly through the curtains, out of a nearby window]]</line>
				<line>HE COULD DECREASE THE SPACE BETWEEN HIS ATOMS, NOT REALLY POSSIBLE EITHER. IT JUST ISN'T.</line>
				<line>&lt;&lt;BOOM..&gt;&gt;</line>
				<line>THE MOST LIKELY WAY HE DOES IT IS BY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF ATOMS IN HIS BODY.</line>
				<line>BUT CHECK IT! BECAUSE OF THE EXPONENTIALLY SMALLER AMOUNT OF NEURONS IN HIS BRAIN, HE'S REALLY STUPID. MAYBE TOO STUPID TO LIVE. MAYBE NOT, CAUSE HE'S A SCIENTIST.</line>

				<line>Beneath the Skirt of the Eastend Enchantress by Rebecca Kraatz</line>
				<line>In 1922 in southern Saskatchewan lived a young woman, Helen, known as the Eastend Enchantress.</line>
				<line>Helen's beauty and talent were comparable to any lass in Hollywood.</line>
				<line>But tragedy struck when she fell off a horse and broke her leg.</line>
				<line>Doctor: Gangrene has set in, Helen. I'm afraid... I'll... I'll have to amputate it.</line>
				<line>Helen: Okay, doctor.</line>
				<line>Soon after she made an announcement.</line>
				<line>Helen: I will give my hand in marriage to the fellow who creates for me the most lovely yet comfortable fake leg.</line>
				<line>One hundred single men went to work.</line>
				<line>Carpenters shaped and carved wood.</line>
				<line>A newspaper reporter made a leg of paper and wrote upon it a declaration of his devotion.</line>
				<line>A blacksmith hammered and fused a gorgeous gam out of iron rods.</line>
				<line>Helen carefully tried on all the legs made for her.</line>
				<line>Helen's thoughts: Hmm?</line>
				<line>She chose to walk down the aisle with a British Archaeologist who was passing through town.</line>
				<line>Underneath her wedding dress was a dinosaur bone the Archaeologist had dug up in the nearby Cypress Hills.</line>

				<line>Lately I've been thinking about the role of popular culture references in popular culture!</line>
				<line>T-REX IN: HYPERREAL COMICS</line>
				<line>I'm getting pretty sick of nostalgic references to things like movies and video games passing for humor and creativity! People bark like trained seals any time they encounter something they're familiar with!</line>
				<line>Heck, there are even subgenres of our culture that exist only to reference other subgenres!</line>
				<line>Don't you think you're being kind of overzealous?</line>
				<line>Maybe! I guess nothing's completely original, but I fear that modern media has become nothing more than a recursive loop with no discernible, objective reality!</line>
				<line>Utrahraptor: It sounds like we're being forced to accept the classical notion that there never was any objective existence in the first place!</line>
				<line>To be honest, all I want is a punchline that doesn't rely on reminding me of what I liked when I was 7!</line>
